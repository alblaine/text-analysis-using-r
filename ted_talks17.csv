2687,Lara Setrakian,3 ways to fix a broken news industry,http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/2687,"Something is very wrong with the news industry. Trust in the media has hit an all-time low; we're inundated with sensationalist stories, and consistent, high-quality reporting is scarce, says journalist Lara Setrakian. She shares three ways we can fix the news to better inform all of us about the complex issues of our time.",http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/2683/transcript?language=en,1,2017,TEDNYC,0:08:37,2/15/17,867855,"iraq,Middle East,Syria,ebola,oceans,intelligence,global issues,community,news,journalism,writing,refugees,innovation,entrepreneur,women,education,Internet,society,communication","0:11


Five years ago, I had my dream job.
I was a foreign correspondent
in the Middle East
reporting for ABC News.
But there was a crack in the wall,
a problem with our industry,
that I felt we needed to fix.
You see, I got to the Middle East
right around the end of 2007,
which was just around the midpoint
of the Iraq War.
But by the time I got there,
it was already nearly impossible
to find stories about Iraq on air.
Coverage had dropped across the board,
across networks.
And of the stories that did make it,
more than 80 percent
of them were about us.
We were missing the stories about Iraq,
the people who live there,
and what was happening to them
under the weight of the war.




 1:00


Afghanistan had already
fallen off the agenda.
There were less than one percent
of all news stories in 2008
that went to the war in Afghanistan.
It was the longest war in US history,
but information was so scarce
that schoolteachers we spoke to
told us they had trouble
explaining to their students
what we were doing there,
when those students had parents
who were fighting
and sometimes dying overseas.




 1:28


We had drawn a blank,
and it wasn't just Iraq and Afghanistan.
From conflict zones to climate change
to all sorts of issues
around crises in public health,
we were missing what I call
the species-level issues,
because as a species,
they could actually sink us.
And by failing to understand
the complex issues of our time,
we were facing certain
practical implications.
How were we going to solve problems
that we didn't fundamentally understand,
that we couldn't track in real time,
and where the people working on the issues
were invisible to us
and sometimes invisible to each other?




 2:08


When you look back on Iraq,
those years when we
were missing the story,
were the years when the society
was falling apart,
when we were setting the conditions
for what would become the rise of ISIS,
the ISIS takeover of Mosul
and terrorist violence that would spread
beyond Iraq's borders
to the rest of the world.




 2:28


Just around that time
where I was making that observation,
I looked across the border of Iraq
and noticed there was another
story we were missing:
the war in Syria.
If you were a Middle-East specialist,
you knew that Syria was that important
from the start.
But it ended up being, really,
one of the forgotten stories
of the Arab Spring.
I saw the implications up front.
Syria is intimately tied
to regional security,
to global stability.
I felt like we couldn't let that become
another one of the stories we left behind.




 3:03


So I left my big TV job to start
a website, called ""Syria Deeply.""
It was designed to be a news
and information source
that made it easier to understand
a complex issue,
and for the past four years,
it's been a resource
for policymakers and professionals
working on the conflict in Syria.
We built a business model
based on consistent,
high-quality information,
and convening the top minds on the issue.
And we found it was a model that scaled.
We got passionate requests
to do other things ""Deeply.""
So we started to work our way
down the list.




 3:42


I'm just one of many entrepreneurs,
and we are just one of many start-ups
trying to fix what's wrong with news.
All of us in the trenches know
that something is wrong
with the news industry.
It's broken.
Trust in the media
has hit an all-time low.
And the statistic you're seeing up there
is from September 
it's arguably gotten worse.
But we can fix this.
We can fix the news.
I know that that's true.
You can call me an idealist;
I call myself an industrious optimist.
And I know there are
a lot of us out there.
We have ideas for how
to make things better,
and I want to share three of them
that we've picked up in our own work.




 4:27


Idea number one:
we need news that's built
on deep-domain knowledge.
Given the waves and waves of layoffs
at newsrooms across the country,
we've lost the art of specialization.
Beat reporting is an endangered thing.
When it comes to foreign news,
the way we can fix that
is by working with more local journalists,
treating them like our partners
and collaborators,
not just fixers who fetch us
phone numbers and sound bites.
Our local reporters in Syria
and across Africa and across Asia
bring us stories that we certainly
would not have found on our own.
Like this one from the suburbs
of Damascus, about a wheelchair race
that gave hope
to those wounded in the war.
Or this one from Sierra Leone,
about a local chief
who curbed the spread of Ebola
by self-organizing
a quarantine in his district.
Or this one from the border of Pakistan,
about Afghan refugees being forced
to return home before they are ready,
under the threat of police intimidation.
Our local journalists are our mentors.
They teach us something new every day,
and they bring us stories
that are important for all of us to know.




 5:36


Idea number two:
we need a kind of Hippocratic oath
for the news industry,
a pledge to first do no harm.




 5:45


(Applause)




 5:47


Journalists need to be tough.
We need to speak truth to power,
but we also need to be responsible.
We need to live up to our own ideals,
and we need to recognize
when what we're doing
could potentially harm society,
where we lose track of journalism
as a public service.




 6:05


I watched us cover the Ebola crisis.
We launched Ebola Deeply. We did our best.
But what we saw was a public
that was flooded with hysterical
and sensational coverage,
sometimes inaccurate,
sometimes completely wrong.
Public health experts tell me
that that actually cost us in human lives,
because by sparking more panic
and by sometimes getting the facts wrong,
we made it harder for people to resolve
what was actually happening on the ground.
All that noise made it harder
to make the right decisions.




 6:36


We can do better as an industry,
but it requires us recognizing
how we got it wrong last time,
and deciding not to go that way next time.
It's a choice.
We have to resist the temptation
to use fear for ratings.
And that decision has to be made
in the individual newsroom
and with the individual news executive.
Because the next deadly virus
that comes around
could be much worse
and the consequences much higher,
if we do what we did last time;
if our reporting isn't responsible
and it isn't right.




 7:10


The third idea?
We need to embrace complexity
if we want to make sense
of a complex world.
Embrace complexity 




 7:19


(Applause)




 7:20


not treat the world simplistically,
because simple isn't accurate.
We live in a complex world.
News is adult education.
It's our job as journalists
to get elbow deep in complexity
and to find new ways to make it easier
for everyone else to understand.
If we don't do that,
if we pretend there are
just simple answers,
we're leading everyone off a steep cliff.
Understanding complexity
is the only way to know the real threats
that are around the corner.
It's our responsibility
to translate those threats
and to help you understand what's real,
so you can be prepared and know
what it takes to be ready
for what comes next.




 8:02


I am an industrious optimist.
I do believe we can fix what's broken.
We all want to.
There are great journalists
out there doing great work 
we just need new formats.
I honestly believe
this is a time of reawakening,
reimagining what we can do.
I believe we can fix what's broken.
I know we can fix the news.
I know it's worth trying,
and I truly believe that in the end,
we're going to get this right.




 8:29


Thank you.

In a wide-ranging conversation full of insight, historian Yuval Harari places our current turmoil in a broader context, against the ongoing disruption of our technology, climate, media -- even our notion of what humanity is for. This is the first of a series of TED Dialogues, seeking a thoughtful response to escalating political divisiveness.

Chris Anderson: Hello.
Welcome to this TED Dialogues.
It's the first of a series
that's going to be done
in response to the current
political upheaval.
I don't know about you;
I've become quite concerned about
the growing divisiveness in this country
and in the world.
No one's listening to each other. Right?
They aren't.
I mean, it feels like we need
a different kind of conversation,
one that's based on  I don't know,
on reason, listening, on understanding,
on a broader context.




 0:45


That's at least what we're going to try
in these TED Dialogues,
starting today.
And we couldn't have anyone with us
who I'd be more excited to kick this off.
This is a mind right here that thinks
pretty much like no one else
on the planet, I would hasten to say.
I'm serious.




 1:02


(Yuval Noah Harari laughs)
I'm serious.
He synthesizes history
with underlying ideas
in a way that kind of takes
your breath away.




 1:12


So, some of you will know
this book, ""Sapiens.""
Has anyone here read ""Sapiens""?




 1:17


(Applause)
I mean, I could not put it down.
The way that he tells the story of mankind
through big ideas that really make you
think differently 
it's kind of amazing.
And here's the follow-up,
which I think is being published
in the US next week.




 1:35


YNH: Yeah, next week.




 1:36


CA: ""Homo Deus.""
Now, this is the history
of the next hundred years.
I've had a chance to read it.
It's extremely dramatic,
and I daresay, for some people,
quite alarming.
It's a must-read.
And honestly, we couldn't have
someone better to help
make sense of what on Earth
is happening in the world right now.
So a warm welcome, please,
to Yuval Noah Harari.




 2:05


(Applause)




 2:13


It's great to be joined by our friends
on Facebook and around the Web.
Hello, Facebook.
And all of you, as I start
asking questions of Yuval,
come up with your own questions,
and not necessarily about
the political scandal du jour,
but about the broader understanding
of: Where are we heading?
You ready? OK, we're going to go.




 2:35


So here we are, Yuval:
New York City, 2017,
there's a new president in power,
and shock waves rippling around the world.
What on Earth is happening?




 2:46


YNH: I think the basic thing that happened
is that we have lost our story.
Humans think in stories,
and we try to make sense of the world
by telling stories.
And for the last few decades,
we had a very simple
and very attractive story
about what's happening in the world.
And the story said that,
oh, what's happening is
that the economy is being globalized,
politics is being liberalized,
and the combination of the two
will create paradise on Earth,
and we just need to keep on
globalizing the economy
and liberalizing the political system,
and everything will be wonderful.
And 2016 is the moment
when a very large segment,
even of the Western world,
stopped believing in this story.
For good or bad reasons 
it doesn't matter.
People stopped believing in the story,
and when you don't have a story,
you don't understand what's happening.




 3:40


CA: Part of you believes that that story
was actually a very effective story.
It worked.




 3:45


YNH: To some extent, yes.
According to some measurements,
we are now in the best time ever
for humankind.
Today, for the first time in history,
more people die from eating too much
than from eating too little,
which is an amazing achievement.




 4:01


(Laughter)




 4:04


Also for the first time in history,
more people die from old age
than from infectious diseases,
and violence is also down.
For the first time in history,
more people commit suicide
than are killed by crime and terrorism
and war put together.
Statistically, you are
your own worst enemy.
At least, of all the people in the world,
you are most likely
to be killed by yourself 




 4:31


(Laughter)




 4:32


which is, again,
very good news, compared 




 4:35


(Laughter)




 4:37


compared to the level of violence
that we saw in previous eras.




 4:41


CA: But this process
of connecting the world
ended up with a large group of people
kind of feeling left out,
and they've reacted.
And so we have this bombshell
that's sort of ripping
through the whole system.
I mean, what do you make
of what's happened?
It feels like the old way
that people thought of politics,
the left-right divide,
has been blown up and replaced.
How should we think of this?




 5:04


YNH: Yeah, the old 20th-century
political model of left versus right
is now largely irrelevant,
and the real divide today
is between global and national,
global or local.
And you see it again all over the world
that this is now the main struggle.
We probably need completely
new political models
and completely new ways
of thinking about politics.
In essence, what you can say
is that we now have global ecology,
we have a global economy
but we have national politics,
and this doesn't work together.
This makes the political
system ineffective,
because it has no control
over the forces that shape our life.
And you have basically two solutions
to this imbalance:
either de-globalize the economy
and turn it back into a national economy,
or globalize the political system.




 5:59


CA: So some, I guess
many liberals out there
view Trump and his government
as kind of irredeemably bad,
just awful in every way.
Do you see any underlying narrative
or political philosophy in there
that is at least worth understanding?
How would you articulate that philosophy?
Is it just the philosophy of nationalism?




 6:27


YNH: I think the underlying
feeling or idea
is that the political system 
something is broken there.
It doesn't empower
the ordinary person anymore.
It doesn't care so much
about the ordinary person anymore,
and I think this diagnosis
of the political disease is correct.
With regard to the answers,
I am far less certain.




 6:52


I think what we are seeing
is the immediate human reaction:
if something doesn't work, let's go back.
And you see it all over the world,
that people, almost nobody
in the political system today,
has any future-oriented vision
of where humankind is going.
Almost everywhere,
you see retrograde vision:
""Let's make America great again,""
like it was great  I don't know 
in the '50s, in the '80s, sometime,
let's go back there.
And you go to Russia
a hundred years after Lenin,
Putin's vision for the future
is basically, ah, let's go back
to the Tsarist empire.
And in Israel, where I come from,
the hottest political vision
of the present is:
""Let's build the temple again.""
So let's go back 2,000 years backwards.
So people are thinking
sometime in the past we've lost it,
and sometimes in the past, it's like
you've lost your way in the city,
and you say OK, let's go back
to the point where I felt secure
and start again.
I don't think this can work,
but a lot of people,
this is their gut instinct.




 7:57


CA: But why couldn't it work?
""America First"" is a very
appealing slogan in many ways.
Patriotism is, in many ways,
a very noble thing.
It's played a role
in promoting cooperation
among large numbers of people.
Why couldn't you have a world
organized in countries,
all of which put themselves first?




 8:18


YNH: For many centuries,
even thousands of years,
patriotism worked quite well.
Of course, it led to wars an so forth,
but we shouldn't focus
too much on the bad.
There are also many,
many positive things about patriotism,
and the ability to have
a large number of people
care about each other,
sympathize with one another,
and come together for collective action.
If you go back to the first nations,
so, thousands of years ago,
the people who lived along
the Yellow River in China 
it was many, many different tribes
and they all depended on the river
for survival and for prosperity,
but all of them also suffered
from periodical floods
and periodical droughts.
And no tribe could really do
anything about it,
because each of them controlled
just a tiny section of the river.




 9:11


And then in a long
and complicated process,
the tribes coalesced together
to form the Chinese nation,
which controlled the entire Yellow River
and had the ability to bring
hundreds of thousands of people together
to build dams and canals
and regulate the river
and prevent the worst floods and droughts
and raise the level
of prosperity for everybody.
And this worked in many places
around the world.




 9:39


But in the 21st century,
technology is changing all that
in a fundamental way.
We are now living  all people
in the world 
are living alongside the same cyber river,
and no single nation can regulate
this river by itself.
We are all living together
on a single planet,
which is threatened by our own actions.
And if you don't have some kind
of global cooperation,
nationalism is just not on the right level
to tackle the problems,
whether it's climate change
or whether it's technological disruption.




10:18


CA: So it was a beautiful idea
in a world where most of the action,
most of the issues,
took place on national scale,
but your argument is that the issues
that matter most today
no longer take place on a national scale
but on a global scale.




10:33


YNH: Exactly. All the major problems
of the world today
are global in essence,
and they cannot be solved
unless through some kind
of global cooperation.
It's not just climate change,
which is, like, the most obvious
example people give.
I think more in terms
of technological disruption.
If you think about, for example,
artificial intelligence,
over the next 20, 30 years
pushing hundreds of millions of people
out of the job market 
this is a problem on a global level.
It will disrupt the economy
of all the countries.




11:08


And similarly, if you think
about, say, bioengineering
and people being afraid of conducting,
I don't know, genetic engineering
research in humans,
it won't help if just
a single country, let's say the US,
outlaws all genetic experiments in humans,
but China or North Korea
continues to do it.
So the US cannot solve it by itself,
and very quickly, the pressure on the US
to do the same will be immense
because we are talking about
high-risk, high-gain technologies.
If somebody else is doing it,
I can't allow myself to remain behind.
The only way to have regulations,
effective regulations,
on things like genetic engineering,
is to have global regulations.
If you just have national regulations,
nobody would like to stay behind.




12:02


CA: So this is really interesting.
It seems to me that this may be one key
to provoking at least
a constructive conversation
between the different sides here,
because I think everyone can agree
that the start point
of a lot of the anger
that's propelled us to where we are
is because of the legitimate
concerns about job loss.
Work is gone, a traditional
way of life has gone,
and it's no wonder
that people are furious about that.
And in general, they have blamed
globalism, global elites,
for doing this to them
without asking their permission,
and that seems like
a legitimate complaint.




12:37


But what I hear you saying
is that  so a key question is:
What is the real cause of job loss,
both now and going forward?
To the extent that it's about globalism,
then the right response,
yes, is to shut down borders
and keep people out
and change trade agreements and so forth.
But you're saying, I think,
that actually the bigger cause of job loss
is not going to be that at all.
It's going to originate
in technological questions,
and we have no chance of solving that
unless we operate as a connected world.




13:11


YNH: Yeah, I think that,
I don't know about the present,
but looking to the future,
it's not the Mexicans or Chinese
who will take the jobs
from the people in Pennsylvania,
it's the robots and algorithms.
So unless you plan to build a big wall
on the border of California 




13:26


(Laughter)




13:27


the wall on the border with Mexico
is going to be very ineffective.
And I was struck when I watched
the debates before the election,
I was struck that certainly Trump
did not even attempt to frighten people
by saying the robots will take your jobs.
Now even if it's not true,
it doesn't matter.
It could have been an extremely
effective way of frightening people 




13:52


(Laughter)




13:53


and galvanizing people:
""The robots will take your jobs!""
And nobody used that line.
And it made me afraid,
because it meant
that no matter what happens
in universities and laboratories,
and there, there is already
an intense debate about it,
but in the mainstream political system
and among the general public,
people are just unaware
that there could be an immense
technological disruption 
not in 200 years,
but in 10, 20, 30 years 
and we have to do something about it now,
partly because most of what we teach
children today in school or in college
is going to be completely irrelevant
to the job market of 2040, 2050.
So it's not something we'll need
to think about in 2040.
We need to think today
what to teach the young people.




14:45


CA: Yeah, no, absolutely.
You've often written about
moments in history
where humankind has ...
entered a new era, unintentionally.
Decisions have been made,
technologies have been developed,
and suddenly the world has changed,
possibly in a way
that's worse for everyone.
So one of the examples
you give in ""Sapiens""
is just the whole agricultural revolution,
which, for an actual person
tilling the fields,
they just picked up a 12-hour
backbreaking workday
instead of six hours in the jungle
and a much more interesting lifestyle.




15:25


(Laughter)




15:26


So are we at another possible
phase change here,
where we kind of sleepwalk into a future
that none of us actually wants?




15:35


YNH: Yes, very much so.
During the agricultural revolution,
what happened is that immense
technological and economic revolution
empowered the human collective,
but when you look at actual
individual lives,
the life of a tiny elite
became much better,
and the lives of the majority of people
became considerably worse.
And this can happen again
in the 21st century.
No doubt the new technologies
will empower the human collective.
But we may end up again
with a tiny elite reaping
all the benefits, taking all the fruits,
and the masses of the population
finding themselves worse
than they were before,
certainly much worse than this tiny elite.




16:21


CA: And those elites
might not even be human elites.
They might be cyborgs or 




16:26


YNH: Yeah, they could be
enhanced super humans.
They could be cyborgs.
They could be completely
nonorganic elites.
They could even be
non-conscious algorithms.
What we see now in the world
is authority shifting away
from humans to algorithms.
More and more decisions 
about personal lives,
about economic matters,
about political matters 
are actually being taken by algorithms.
If you ask the bank for a loan,
chances are your fate is decided
by an algorithm, not by a human being.
And the general impression
is that maybe Homo sapiens just lost it.




17:04


The world is so complicated,
there is so much data,
things are changing so fast,
that this thing that evolved
on the African savanna
tens of thousands of years ago 
to cope with a particular environment,
a particular volume
of information and data 
it just can't handle the realities
of the 21st century,
and the only thing
that may be able to handle it
is big-data algorithms.
So no wonder more and more authority
is shifting from us to the algorithms.




17:39


CA: So we're in New York City
for the first of a series of TED Dialogues
with Yuval Harari,
and there's a Facebook Live
audience out there.
We're excited to have you with us.
We'll start coming
to some of your questions
and questions of people in the room
in just a few minutes,
so have those coming.




17:58


Yuval, if you're going
to make the argument
that we need to get past nationalism
because of the coming technological ...
danger, in a way,
presented by so much of what's happening
we've got to have
a global conversation about this.
Trouble is, it's hard to get people
really believing that, I don't know,
AI really is an imminent
threat, and so forth.
The things that people,
some people at least,
care about much more immediately, perhaps,
is climate change,
perhaps other issues like refugees,
nuclear weapons, and so forth.
Would you argue that where
we are right now
that somehow those issues
need to be dialed up?
You've talked about climate change,
but Trump has said
he doesn't believe in that.
So in a way, your most powerful argument,
you can't actually use to make this case.




18:53


YNH: Yeah, I think with climate change,
at first sight, it's quite surprising
that there is a very close correlation
between nationalism and climate change.
I mean, almost always, the people
who deny climate change are nationalists.
And at first sight, you think: Why?
What's the connection?
Why don't you have socialists
denying climate change?
But then, when you think
about it, it's obvious 
because nationalism has no solution
to climate change.
If you want to be a nationalist
in the 21st century,
you have to deny the problem.
If you accept the reality of the problem,
then you must accept that, yes,
there is still room in the world
for patriotism,
there is still room in the world
for having special loyalties
and obligations towards your own people,
towards your own country.
I don't think anybody is really
thinking of abolishing that.




19:46


But in order to confront climate change,
we need additional loyalties
and commitments
to a level beyond the nation.
And that should not be impossible,
because people can have
several layers of loyalty.
You can be loyal to your family
and to your community
and to your nation,
so why can't you also be loyal
to humankind as a whole?
Of course, there are occasions
when it becomes difficult,
what to put first,
but, you know, life is difficult.
Handle it.




20:19


(Laughter)




20:22


CA: OK, so I would love to get
some questions from the audience here.
We've got a microphone here.
Speak into it, and Facebook,
get them coming, too.




20:32


Howard Morgan: One of the things that has
clearly made a huge difference
in this country and other countries
is the income distribution inequality,
the dramatic change
in income distribution in the US
from what it was 50 years ago,
and around the world.
Is there anything we can do
to affect that?
Because that gets at a lot
of the underlying causes.




20:55


YNH: So far I haven't heard a very
good idea about what to do about it,
again, partly because most ideas
remain on the national level,
and the problem is global.
I mean, one idea that we hear
quite a lot about now
is universal basic income.
But this is a problem.
I mean, I think it's a good start,
but it's a problematic idea because
it's not clear what ""universal"" is
and it's not clear what ""basic"" is.
Most people when they speak
about universal basic income,
they actually mean national basic income.
But the problem is global.




21:27


Let's say that you have AI and 3D printers
taking away millions of jobs
in Bangladesh,
from all the people who make
my shirts and my shoes.
So what's going to happen?
The US government will levy taxes
on Google and Apple in California,
and use that to pay basic income
to unemployed Bangladeshis?
If you believe that,
you can just as well believe
that Santa Claus will come
and solve the problem.
So unless we have really universal
and not national basic income,
the deep problems
are not going to go away.




22:04


And also it's not clear what basic is,
because what are basic human needs?
A thousand years ago,
just food and shelter was enough.
But today, people will say
education is a basic human need,
it should be part of the package.
But how much? Six years?
Twelve years? PhD?
Similarly, with health care,
let's say that in 20, 30, 40 years,
you'll have expensive treatments
that can extend human life
to 120, I don't know.
Will this be part of the basket
of basic income or not?
It's a very difficult problem,
because in a world where people
lose their ability to be employed,
the only thing they are going to get
is this basic income.
So what's part of it is a very,
very difficult ethical question.




22:54


CA: There's a bunch of questions
on how the world affords it as well,
who pays.
There's a question here
from Facebook from Lisa Larson:
""How does nationalism in the US now
compare to that between
World War I and World War II
in the last century?""




23:08


YNH: Well the good news, with regard
to the dangers of nationalism,
we are in a much better position
than a century ago.
A century ago, 1917,
Europeans were killing
each other by the millions.
In 2016, with Brexit,
as far as I remember,
a single person lost their life,
an MP who was murdered by some extremist.
Just a single person.
I mean, if Brexit was about
British independence,
this is the most peaceful
war of independence in human history.
And let's say that Scotland
will now choose to leave the UK
after Brexit.




23:49


So in the 18th century,
if Scotland wanted  and the Scots
wanted several times 
to break out of the control of London,
the reaction of the government
in London was to send an army up north
to burn down Edinburgh
and massacre the highland tribes.
My guess is that if, in 2018,
the Scots vote for independence,
the London government
will not send an army up north
to burn down Edinburgh.
Very few people are now willing
to kill or be killed
for Scottish or for British independence.
So for all the talk
of the rise of nationalism
and going back to the 1930s,
to the 19th century, in the West at least,
the power of national sentiments
today is far, far smaller
than it was a century ago.




24:43


CA: Although some people now,
you hear publicly worrying
about whether that might be shifting,
that there could actually be
outbreaks of violence in the US
depending on how things turn out.
Should we be worried about that,
or do you really think
things have shifted?




24:59


YNH: No, we should be worried.
We should be aware of two things.
First of all, don't be hysterical.
We are not back
in the First World War yet.
But on the other hand,
don't be complacent.
We reached from 1917 to 2017,
not by some divine miracle,
but simply by human decisions,
and if we now start making
the wrong decisions,
we could be back
in an analogous situation to 1917
in a few years.
One of the things I know as a historian
is that you should never
underestimate human stupidity.




25:35


(Laughter)




25:38


It's one of the most powerful
forces in history,
human stupidity and human violence.
Humans do such crazy things
for no obvious reason,
but again, at the same time,
another very powerful force
in human history is human wisdom.
We have both.




25:54


CA: We have with us here
moral psychologist Jonathan Haidt,
who I think has a question.




25:59


Jonathan Haidt: Thanks, Yuval.
So you seem to be a fan
of global governance,
but when you look at the map of the world
from Transparency International,
which rates the level of corruption
of political institutions,
it's a vast sea of red with little bits
of yellow here and there
for those with good institutions.
So if we were to have
some kind of global governance,
what makes you think it would end up
being more like Denmark
rather than more like Russia or Honduras,
and aren't there alternatives,
such as we did with CFCs?
There are ways to solve global problems
with national governments.
What would world government
actually look like,
and why do you think it would work?




26:33


YNH: Well, I don't know
what it would look like.
Nobody still has a model for that.
The main reason we need it
is because many of these issues
are lose-lose situations.
When you have
a win-win situation like trade,
both sides can benefit
from a trade agreement,
then this is something you can work out.
Without some kind of global government,
national governments each
have an interest in doing it.
But when you have a lose-lose situation
like with climate change,
it's much more difficult
without some overarching
authority, real authority.




27:11


Now, how to get there
and what would it look like,
I don't know.
And certainly there is no obvious reason
to think that it would look like Denmark,
or that it would be a democracy.
Most likely it wouldn't.
We don't have workable democratic models
for a global government.
So maybe it would look more
like ancient China
than like modern Denmark.
But still, given the dangers
that we are facing,
I think the imperative of having
some kind of real ability
to force through difficult decisions
on the global level
is more important
than almost anything else.




27:58


CA: There's a question from Facebook here,
and then we'll get the mic to Andrew.
So, Kat Hebron on Facebook,
calling in from Vail:
""How would developed nations manage
the millions of climate migrants?""




28:11


YNH: I don't know.




28:13


CA: That's your answer, Kat. (Laughter)




28:15


YNH: And I don't think
that they know either.
They'll just deny the problem, maybe.




28:19


CA: But immigration, generally,
is another example of a problem
that's very hard to solve
on a nation-by-nation basis.
One nation can shut its doors,
but maybe that stores up
problems for the future.




28:29


YNH: Yes, I mean 
it's another very good case,
especially because it's so much easier
to migrate today
than it was in the Middle Ages
or in ancient times.




28:41


CA: Yuval, there's a belief
among many technologists, certainly,
that political concerns
are kind of overblown,
that actually, political leaders
don't have that much influence
in the world,
that the real determination of humanity
at this point is by science,
by invention, by companies,
by many things
other than political leaders,
and it's actually very hard
for leaders to do much,
so we're actually worrying
about nothing here.




29:09


YNH: Well, first, it should be emphasized
that it's true that political leaders'
ability to do good is very limited,
but their ability to do harm is unlimited.
There is a basic imbalance here.
You can still press the button
and blow everybody up.
You have that kind of ability.
But if you want, for example,
to reduce inequality,
that's very, very difficult.
But to start a war,
you can still do so very easily.
So there is a built-in imbalance
in the political system today
which is very frustrating,
where you cannot do a lot of good
but you can still do a lot of harm.
And this makes the political system
still a very big concern.




29:50


CA: So as you look at
what's happening today,
and putting your historian's hat on,
do you look back in history at moments
when things were going just fine
and an individual leader really took
the world or their country backwards?




30:04


YNH: There are quite a few examples,
but I should emphasize,
it's never an individual leader.
I mean, somebody put him there,
and somebody allowed him
to continue to be there.
So it's never really just the fault
of a single individual.
There are a lot of people
behind every such individual.




30:23


CA: Can we have the microphone
here, please, to Andrew?




30:30


Andrew Solomon: You've talked a lot
about the global versus the national,
but increasingly, it seems to me,
the world situation
is in the hands of identity groups.
We look at people within the United States
who have been recruited by ISIS.
We look at these other groups
which have formed
which go outside of national bounds
but still represent
significant authorities.
How are they to be integrated
into the system,
and how is a diverse set of identities
to be made coherent
under either national
or global leadership?




30:58


YNH: Well, the problem
of such diverse identities
is a problem from nationalism as well.
Nationalism believes
in a single, monolithic identity,
and exclusive or at least
more extreme versions of nationalism
believe in an exclusive loyalty
to a single identity.
And therefore, nationalism has had
a lot of problems
with people wanting to divide
their identities
between various groups.
So it's not just a problem, say,
for a global vision.




31:29


And I think, again, history shows
that you shouldn't necessarily
think in such exclusive terms.
If you think that there is just
a single identity for a person,
""I am just X, that's it, I can't be
several things, I can be just that,""
that's the start of the problem.
You have religions, you have nations
that sometimes demand exclusive loyalty,
but it's not the only option.
There are many religions and many nations
that enable you to have
diverse identities at the same time.




32:04


CA: But is one explanation
of what's happened in the last year
that a group of people have got
fed up with, if you like,
the liberal elites,
for want of a better term,
obsessing over many, many different
identities and them feeling,
""But what about my identity?
I am being completely ignored here.
And by the way, I thought
I was the majority""?
And that that's actually
sparked a lot of the anger.




32:31


YNH: Yeah. Identity is always problematic,
because identity is always based
on fictional stories
that sooner or later collide with reality.
Almost all identities,
I mean, beyond the level
of the basic community
of a few dozen people,
are based on a fictional story.
They are not the truth.
They are not the reality.
It's just a story that people invent
and tell one another
and start believing.
And therefore all identities
are extremely unstable.
They are not a biological reality.
Sometimes nationalists, for example,
think that the nation
is a biological entity.
It's made of the combination
of soil and blood,
creates the nation.
But this is just a fictional story.




33:20


CA: Soil and blood
kind of makes a gooey mess.




33:22


(Laughter)




33:24


YNH: It does, and also
it messes with your mind
when you think too much
that I am a combination of soil and blood.
If you look from a biological perspective,
obviously none of the nations
that exist today
existed 5,000 years ago.
Homo sapiens is a social animal,
that's for sure.
But for millions of years,
Homo sapiens and our hominid ancestors
lived in small communities
of a few dozen individuals.
Everybody knew everybody else.
Whereas modern nations
are imagined communities,
in the sense that I don't even know
all these people.
I come from a relatively
small nation, Israel,
and of eight million Israelis,
I never met most of them.
I will never meet most of them.
They basically exist here.




34:15


CA: But in terms of this identity,
this group who feel left out
and perhaps have work taken away,
I mean, in ""Homo Deus,""
you actually speak of this group
in one sense expanding,
that so many people
may have their jobs taken away
by technology in some way
that we could end up with
a really large  I think you call it
a ""useless class"" 
a class where traditionally,
as viewed by the economy,
these people have no use.




34:45


YNH: Yes.




34:46


CA: How likely a possibility is that?
Is that something
we should be terrified about?
And can we address it in any way?




34:54


YNH: We should think about it
very carefully.
I mean, nobody really knows
what the job market will look like
in 2040, 2050.
There is a chance
many new jobs will appear,
but it's not certain.
And even if new jobs do appear,
it won't necessarily be easy
for a 50-year old unemployed truck driver
made unemployed by self-driving vehicles,
it won't be easy
for an unemployed truck driver
to reinvent himself or herself
as a designer of virtual worlds.




35:25


Previously, if you look at the trajectory
of the industrial revolution,
when machines replaced humans
in one type of work,
the solution usually came
from low-skill work
in new lines of business.
So you didn't need any more
agricultural workers,
so people moved to working
in low-skill industrial jobs,
and when this was taken away
by more and more machines,
people moved to low-skill service jobs.
Now, when people say there will
be new jobs in the future,
that humans can do better than AI,
that humans can do better than robots,
they usually think about high-skill jobs,
like software engineers
designing virtual worlds.
Now, I don't see how
an unemployed cashier from Wal-Mart
reinvents herself or himself at 50
as a designer of virtual worlds,
and certainly I don't see
how the millions of unemployed
Bangladeshi textile workers
will be able to do that.
I mean, if they are going to do it,
we need to start teaching
the Bangladeshis today
how to be software designers,
and we are not doing it.
So what will they do in 20 years?




36:37


CA: So it feels like you're really
highlighting a question
that's really been bugging me
the last few months more ",Transcript extended into text file

Joseph Keller used to jog
around the Stanford campus,
and he was struck by all the women
jogging there as well.
Why did their ponytails swing
from side to side like that?
Being a mathematician,
he set out to understand why.




 0:28


(Laughter)




 0:29


Professor Keller was curious
about many things:
why teapots dribble
or how earthworms wriggle.
Until a few months ago,
I hadn't heard of Joseph Keller.
I read about him in the New York Times,
in the obituaries.
The Times had half a page
of editorial dedicated to him,
which you can imagine is premium space
for a newspaper of their stature.




 0:52


I read the obituaries almost every day.
My wife understandably thinks
I'm rather morbid
to begin my day with scrambled eggs
and a ""Let's see who died today.""




 1:03


(Laughter)




 1:05


But if you think about it,
the front page of the newspaper
is usually bad news,
and cues man's failures.
An instance where bad news
cues accomplishment
is at the end of the paper,
in the obituaries.




 1:18


In my day job,
I run a company that focuses
on future insights
that marketers can derive
from past data 
a kind of rearview-mirror analysis.
And we began to think:
What if we held a rearview mirror
to obituaries from the New York Times?
Were there lessons on how you could get
your obituary featured 
even if you aren't around to enjoy it?




 1:41


(Laughter)




 1:42


Would this go better with scrambled eggs?




 1:45


(Laughter)




 1:47


And so, we looked at the data.
2,000 editorial, non-paid obituaries
over a 20-month period
between 2015 and 2016.
What did these 2,000 deaths 
rather, lives  teach us?




 2:03


Well, first we looked at words.
This here is an obituary headline.
This one is of the amazing Lee Kuan Yew.
If you remove the beginning and the end,
you're left with a beautifully
worded descriptor
that tries to, in just a few words,
capture an achievement or a lifetime.
Just looking at these is fascinating.
Here are a few famous ones,
people who died in the last two years.
Try and guess who they are.




 2:27


[An Artist who Defied Genre]
That's Prince.




 2:31


[Titan of Boxing and the 20th Century]
Oh, yes.




 2:34


[Muhammad Ali]




 2:35


[Groundbreaking Architect]
Zaha Hadid.




 2:39


So we took these descriptors
and did what's called
natural language processing,
where you feed these into a program,
it throws out the superfluous words 
""the,"" ""and,""  the kind of words
you can mime easily in ""Charades,"" 
and leaves you with the most
significant words.
And we did it not just for these four,
but for all 2,000 descriptors.
And this is what it looks like.
Film, theatre, music, dance
and of course, art, are huge.
Over 40 percent.
You have to wonder
why in so many societies
we insist that our kids pursue
engineering or medicine or business or law
to be construed as successful.
And while we're talking profession,
let's look at age 
the average age at which
they achieved things.
That number is 37.
What that means is,
you've got to wait 37 years ...
before your first significant achievement
that you're remembered for 
on average 
44 years later, when you
die at the age of 81 
on average.




 3:39


(Laughter)




 3:40


Talk about having to be patient.




 3:41


(Laughter)




 3:43


Of course, it varies by profession.
If you're a sports star,
you'll probably hit
your stride in your 20s.
And if you're in your 40s like me,
you can join the fun world of politics.




 3:53


(Laughter)




 3:54


Politicians do their first and sometimes
only commendable act in their mid-40s.




 3:58


(Laughter)




 3:59


If you're wondering what ""others"" are,
here are some examples.
Isn't it fascinating, the things people do
and the things they're remembered for?




 4:07


(Laughter)




 4:11


Our curiosity was in overdrive,
and we desired to analyze
more than just a descriptor.
So, we ingested the entire
first paragraph of all 2,000 obituaries,
but we did this separately
for two groups of people:
people that are famous
and people that are not famous.
Famous people  Prince,
Ali, Zaha Hadid 
people who are not famous
are people like Jocelyn Cooper,
Reverend Curry
or Lorna Kelly.
I'm willing to bet you haven't heard
of most of their names.
Amazing people, fantastic achievements,
but they're not famous.
So what if we analyze
these two groups separately 
the famous and the non-famous?
What might that tell us?




 4:51


Take a look.
Two things leap out at me.
First:
""John.""




 5:00


(Laughter)




 5:02


Anyone here named John
should thank your parents 




 5:06


(Laughter)




 5:07


and remind your kids to cut out
your obituary when you're gone.
And second:
""help.""




 5:17


We uncovered, many lessons
from lives well-led,
and what those people immortalized
in print could teach us.
The exercise was a fascinating testament
to the kaleidoscope that is life,
and even more fascinating
was the fact that the overwhelming
majority of obituaries
featured people famous and non-famous,
who did seemingly extraordinary things.
They made a positive dent
in the fabric of life.
They helped.




 5:45


So ask yourselves as you go
back to your daily lives:
How am I using my talents to help society?
Because the most powerful lesson here is,
if more people lived their lives
trying to be famous in death,
the world would be a much better place.




 6:02


Thank you.




 6:03

2703,Megan Phelps-Roper,I grew up in the Westboro Baptist Church.

I was a blue-eyed,
chubby-cheeked five-year-old
when I joined my family
on the picket line for the first time.
My mom made me leave
my dolls in the minivan.
I'd stand on a street corner
in the heavy Kansas humidity,
surrounded by a few dozen relatives,
with my tiny fists clutching
a sign that I couldn't read yet:
""Gays are worthy of death.""
This was the beginning.




 0:36


Our protests soon became
a daily occurrence
and an international phenomenon,
and as a member
of Westboro Baptist Church,
I became a fixture
on picket lines across the country.
The end of my antigay picketing career
and life as I knew it,
came 20 years later,
triggered in part by strangers on Twitter
who showed me the power
of engaging the other.




 0:58


In my home,
life was framed as an epic
spiritual battle between good and evil.
The good was my church and its members,
and the evil was everyone else.
My church's antics were such
that we were constantly
at odds with the world,
and that reinforced
our otherness on a daily basis.
""Make a difference
between the unclean and the clean,""
the verse says,
and so we did.
From baseball games to military funerals,
we trekked across the country
with neon protest signs in hand
to tell others exactly
how ""unclean"" they were
and exactly why
they were headed for damnation.
This was the focus of our whole lives.
This was the only way for me to do good
in a world that sits in Satan's lap.
And like the rest of my 10 siblings,
I believed what I was taught
with all my heart,
and I pursued Westboro's agenda
with a special sort of zeal.




 1:51


In 2009, that zeal brought me to Twitter.
Initially, the people
I encountered on the platform
were just as hostile as I expected.
They were the digital version
of the screaming hordes
I'd been seeing at protests
since I was a kid.
But in the midst of that digital brawl,
a strange pattern developed.
Someone would arrive at my profile
with the usual rage and scorn,
I would respond with a custom mix
of Bible verses, pop culture references
and smiley faces.
They would be understandably
confused and caught off guard,
but then a conversation would ensue.
And it was civil 
full of genuine curiosity on both sides.
How had the other come to such
outrageous conclusions about the world?




 2:36


Sometimes the conversation
even bled into real life.
People I'd sparred with on Twitter
would come out
to the picket line to see me
when I protested in their city.
A man named David was one such person.
He ran a blog called ""Jewlicious,""
and after several months
of heated but friendly arguments online,
he came out to see me
at a picket in New Orleans.
He brought me a Middle Eastern dessert
from Jerusalem, where he lives,
and I brought him kosher chocolate
and held a ""God hates Jews"" sign.




 3:05


(Laughter)




 3:08


There was no confusion
about our positions,
but the line between friend and foe
was becoming blurred.
We'd started to see each other
as human beings,
and it changed the way
we spoke to one another.




 3:19


It took time,
but eventually these conversations
planted seeds of doubt in me.
My friends on Twitter took the time
to understand Westboro's doctrines,
and in doing so,
they were able to find inconsistencies
I'd missed my entire life.
Why did we advocate
the death penalty for gays
when Jesus said, ""Let he who is
without sin cast the first stone?""
How could we claim to love our neighbor
while at the same time
praying for God to destroy them?
The truth is that the care shown to me
by these strangers on the internet
was itself a contradiction.
It was growing evidence
that people on the other side were not
the demons I'd been led to believe.




 3:59


These realizations were life-altering.
Once I saw that we were not
the ultimate arbiters of divine truth
but flawed human beings,
I couldn't pretend otherwise.
I couldn't justify our actions 
especially our cruel practice
of protesting funerals
and celebrating human tragedy.
These shifts in my perspective
contributed to a larger erosion
of trust in my church,
and eventually it made it
impossible for me to stay.




 4:27


In spite of overwhelming grief and terror,
I left Westboro in 2012.
In those days just after I left,
the instinct to hide
was almost paralyzing.
I wanted to hide
from the judgement of my family,
who I knew would never
speak to me again 
people whose thoughts and opinions
had meant everything to me.
And I wanted to hide from the world
I'd rejected for so long 
people who had no reason at all
to give me a second chance
after a lifetime of antagonism.
And yet, unbelievably,
they did.

The world had access to my past
because it was all over the internet 
thousands of tweets
and hundreds of interviews,
everything from local TV news
to ""The Howard Stern Show"" 
but so many embraced me
with open arms anyway.
I wrote an apology
for the harm I'd caused,
but I also knew that an apology
could never undo any of it.
All I could do was try to build a new life
and find a way somehow
to repair some of the damage.
People had every reason
to doubt my sincerity,
but most of them didn't.
And 
given my history,
it was more than I could've hoped for 
forgiveness and the benefit of the doubt.
It still amazes me.




 5:39


I spent my first year away from home
adrift with my younger sister,
who had chosen to leave with me.
We walked into an abyss,
but we were shocked to find
the light and a way forward
in the same communities
we'd targeted for so long.
David,
my ""Jewlicious"" friend from Twitter,
invited us to spend time among
a Jewish community in Los Angeles.
We slept on couches in the home
of a Hasidic rabbi and his wife
and their four kids 
the same rabbi that I'd protested
three years earlier
with a sign that said,
""Your rabbi is a whore.""
We spent long hours talking
about theology and Judaism and life
while we washed dishes
in their kosher kitchen
and chopped vegetables for dinner.
They treated us like family.
They held nothing against us,
and again I was astonished.




 6:31


That period was full of turmoil,
but one part I've returned to often
is a surprising realization
I had during that time 
that it was a relief and a privilege
to let go of the harsh judgments
that instinctively ran through my mind
about nearly every person I saw.
I realized that now I needed to learn.
I needed to listen.




 6:54


This has been at the front
of my mind lately,
because I can't help but see
in our public discourse
so many of the same destructive impulses
that ruled my former church.
We celebrate tolerance and diversity
more than at any other time in memory,
and still we grow more and more divided.
We want good things 
justice, equality,
freedom, dignity, prosperity 
but the path we've chosen
looks so much like the one
I walked away from four years ago.
We've broken the world into us and them,
only emerging from our bunkers long enough
to lob rhetorical grenades
at the other camp.
We write off half the country
as out-of-touch liberal elites
or racist misogynist bullies.
No nuance, no complexity, no humanity.
Even when someone does call for empathy
and understanding for the other side,
the conversation nearly always devolves
into a debate about
who deserves more empathy.
And just as I learned to do,
we routinely refuse to acknowledge
the flaws in our positions
or the merits in our opponent's.
Compromise is anathema.
We even target people on our own side
when they dare to question the party line.
This path has brought us cruel,
sniping, deepening polarization,
and even outbreaks of violence.
I remember this path.
It will not take us where we want to go.




 8:18


What gives me hope is that
we can do something about this.
The good news is that it's simple,
and the bad news is that it's hard.
We have to talk and listen
to people we disagree with.
It's hard because we often can't fathom
how the other side
came to their positions.
It's hard because righteous indignation,
that sense of certainty
that ours is the right side,
is so seductive.
It's hard because it means
extending empathy and compassion
to people who show us
hostility and contempt.
The impulse to respond in kind
is so tempting,
but that isn't who we want to be.
We can resist.
And I will always be inspired to do so
by those people I encountered on Twitter,
apparent enemies
who became my beloved friends.
And in the case of one particularly
understanding and generous guy,
my husband.
There was nothing special
about the way I responded to him.
What was special was their approach.
I thought about it a lot
over the past few years
and I found four things
they did differently
that made real conversation possible.
These four steps were small but powerful,
and I do everything I can to employ them
in difficult conversations today.




 9:35


The first is don't assume bad intent.
My friends on Twitter realized
that even when my words
were aggressive and offensive,
I sincerely believed
I was doing the right thing.
Assuming ill motives
almost instantly cuts us off
from truly understanding
why someone does and believes as they do.
We forget that they're a human being
with a lifetime of experience
that shaped their mind,
and we get stuck
on that first wave of anger,
and the conversation has a very hard time
ever moving beyond it.
But when we assume good or neutral intent,
we give our minds a much stronger
framework for dialogue.




10:13


The second is ask questions.
When we engage people
across ideological divides,
asking questions
helps us map the disconnect
between our differing points of view.
That's important because
we can't present effective arguments
if we don't understand where
the other side is actually coming from
and because it gives them an opportunity
to point out flaws in our positions.
But asking questions
serves another purpose;
it signals to someone
that they're being heard.
When my friends on Twitter
stopped accusing
and started asking questions,
I almost automatically mirrored them.
Their questions gave me room to speak,
but they also gave me permission
to ask them questions
and to truly hear their responses.
It fundamentally changed
the dynamic of our conversation.




11:01


The third is stay calm.
This takes practice and patience,
but it's powerful.
At Westboro, I learned not to care
how my manner of speaking affected others.
I thought my rightness
justified my rudeness 
harsh tones, raised voices,
insults, interruptions 
but that strategy
is ultimately counterproductive.
Dialing up the volume and the snark
is natural in stressful situations,
but it tends to bring the conversation
to an unsatisfactory, explosive end.
When my husband was still
just an anonymous Twitter acquaintance,
our discussions frequently
became hard and pointed,
but we always refused to escalate.
Instead, he would change the subject.
He would tell a joke or recommend a book
or gently excuse himself
from the conversation.
We knew the discussion wasn't over,
just paused for a time
to bring us back to an even keel.
People often lament that digital
communication makes us less civil,
but this is one advantage that online
conversations have over in-person ones.
We have a buffer of time and space
between us and the people
whose ideas we find so frustrating.
We can use that buffer.
Instead of lashing out,
we can pause, breathe,
change the subject or walk away,
and then come back to it when we're ready.




12:21


And finally ...
make the argument.
This might seem obvious,
but one side effect
of having strong beliefs
is that we sometimes assume
that the value of our position
is or should be obvious and self-evident,
that we shouldn't
have to defend our positions
because they're so clearly right and good
that if someone doesn't get it,
it's their problem 
that it's not my job to educate them.
But if it were that simple,
we would all see things the same way.
As kind as my friends on Twitter were,
if they hadn't actually
made their arguments,
it would've been so much harder for me
to see the world in a different way.
We are all a product of our upbringing,
and our beliefs reflect our experiences.
We can't expect others
to spontaneously change their own minds.
If we want change,
we have to make the case for it.




13:16


My friends on Twitter didn't abandon
their beliefs or their principles 
only their scorn.
They channeled their
infinitely justifiable offense
and came to me with pointed questions
tempered with kindness and humor.
They approached me as a human being,
and that was more transformative
than two full decades
of outrage, disdain and violence.
I know that some might not have
the time or the energy or the patience
for extensive engagement,
but as difficult as it can be,
reaching out to someone we disagree with
is an option that is
available to all of us.
And I sincerely believe
that we can do hard things,
not just for them
but for us and our future.
Escalating disgust
and intractable conflict
are not what we want for ourselves,
or our country
or our next generation.




14:08


My mom said something to me
a few weeks before I left Westboro,
when I was desperately hoping
there was a way
I could stay with my family.
People I have loved
with every pulse of my heart
since even before I was
that chubby-cheeked five-year-old,
standing on a picket line
holding a sign I couldn't read.
She said, ""You're just a human being,
my dear, sweet child.""
She was asking me to be humble 
not to question
but to trust God and my elders.
But to me, she was missing
the bigger picture 
that we're all just human beings.
That we should be guided
by that most basic fact,
and approach one another
with generosity and compassion.




14:51


Each one of us
contributes to the communities
and the cultures and the societies
that we make up.
The end of this spiral of rage and blame
begins with one person
who refuses to indulge
these destructive, seductive impulses.
We just have to decide
that it's going to start with us.




15:09


Thank you.

Chris Anderson: Welcome
to this next edition of TED Dialogues.
We're trying to do
some bridging here today.
You know, the American dream
has inspired millions of people
around the world for many years.
Today, I think, you can say
that America is divided,
perhaps more than ever,
and the divisions seem
to be getting worse.
It's actually really hard
for people on different sides
to even have a conversation.
People almost feel...
disgusted with each other.
Some families can't even speak
to each other right now.
Our purpose in this dialogue today
is to try to do something about that,
to try to have a different kind
of conversation,
to do some listening, some thinking,
some understanding.
And I have two people with us
to help us do that.




 1:05


They're not going to come at this
hammer and tong against each other.
This is not like cable news.
This is two people who have both spent
a lot of their working life
in the political center
or right of the center.
They've immersed themselves
in conservative worldviews, if you like.
They know that space very well.
And we're going to explore together
how to think about
what is happening right now,
and whether we can find new ways to bridge
and just to have wiser,
more connected conversations.




 1:35


With me, first of all, Gretchen Carlson,
who has spent a decade
working at Fox News,
hosting ""Fox and Friends""
and then ""The Real Story,""
before taking a courageous stance
in filing sexual harassment claims
against Roger Ailes,
which eventually led
to his departure from Fox News.
David Brooks, who has earned the wrath
of many of [The New York Times's]
left-leaning readers
because of his conservative views,
and more recently, perhaps,
some of the right-leaning readers
because of his criticism
of some aspects of Trump.
Yet, his columns are usually
the top one, two or three
most-read content of the day
because they're brilliant,
because they bring psychology
and social science
to providing understanding
for what's going on.
So without further ado, a huge welcome
to Gretchen and David.
Come and join me.




 2:33


(Applause)




 2:37


So, Gretchen.
Sixty-three million Americans
voted for Donald Trump.
Why did they do this?




 2:47


Gretchen Carlson: There are a lot
of reasons, in my mind, why it happened.
I mean, I think it was a movement
of sorts, but it started long ago.
It didn't just happen overnight.
""Anger"" would be the first word
that I would think of 
anger with nothing
being done in Washington,
anger about not being heard.
I think there was a huge swath
of the population
that feels like Washington
never listens to them,
you know, a good part of the middle
of America, not just the coasts,
and he was somebody they felt
was listening to their concerns.
So I think those two issues
would be the main reason.
I have to throw in there also celebrity.
I think that had a huge impact
on Donald Trump becoming president.




 3:34


CA: Was the anger justified?




 3:37


David Brooks: Yeah, I think so.
In 2015 and early 2016,
I wrote about 30 columns
with the following theme:
don't worry, Donald Trump will never
be the Republican nominee.




 3:47


(Laughter)




 3:48


And having done that
and gotten that so wrong,
I decided to spend the ensuing year
just out in Trumpworld,
and I found a lot of economic dislocation.
I ran into a woman in West Virginia
who was going to a funeral for her mom.
She said, ""The nice thing about
being Catholic is we don't have to speak,
and that's good,
because we're not word people.""
That phrase rung in my head: word people.
A lot of us in the TED community
are word people,
but if you're not, the economy
has not been angled toward you,
and so 11 million men, for example,
are out of the labor force
because those jobs are done away.
A lot of social injury.
You used to be able to say,
""I'm not the richest person in the world,
I'm not the most famous,
but my neighbors can count on me
and I get some dignity out of that.""
And because of celebritification
or whatever, if you're not rich or famous,
you feel invisible.
And a lot of moral injury,
sense of feeling betrayed,
and frankly, in this country,
we almost have one success story,
which is you go to college, get
a white-collar job, and you're a success,
and if you don't fit in that formula,
you feel like you're not respected.
And so that accumulation of things 
and when I talked to Trump
voters and still do,
I found most of them completely
realistic about his failings,
but they said, this is my shot.




 4:58


GC: And yet I predicted
that he would be the nominee,
because I've known him for 27 years.
He's a master marketer,
and one of the things
he did extremely well
that President Obama also did
extremely well,
was simplifying the message,
simplifying down to phrases
and to a populist message.
Even if he can't achieve it,
it sounded good.
And many people latched on
to that simplicity again.
It's something they could grasp onto:
""I get that. I want that.
That sounds fantastic.""
And I remember when he used to come
on my show originally,
before ""The Apprentice""
was even ""The Apprentice,""
and he'd say it was the number
one show on TV.
I'd say back to him, ""No, it's not.""
And he would say, ""Yes it is, Gretchen.""
And I would say, ""No it's not.""
But people at home would see that,
and they'd be like,
""Wow, I should be watching
the number one show on TV.""
And  lo and behold  it became
the number one show on TV.
So he had this, I've seen
this ability in him
to be the master marketer.




 5:56


CA: It's puzzling
to a lot of people on the left
that so many women voted for him,
despite some of his comments.




 6:04


GC: I wrote a column
about this for Time Motto,
saying that I really believe
that lot of people put on blinders,
and maybe for the first time,
some people decided
that policies they believed in
and being heard
and not being invisible anymore
was more important to them
than the way in which he had acted
or acts as a human.
And so human dignity 
whether it would be the dust-up
about the disabled reporter,
or what happened
in that audiotape with Billy Bush
and the way in which he spoke
about women 
they put that aside
and pretended as if
they hadn't seen that or heard that,
because to them,
policies were more important.




 6:46


CA: Right, so just because
someone voted for Trump,
it's not blind adherence to everything
that he's said or stood for.




 6:53


GC: No. I heard a lot of people
that would say to me,
""Wow, I just wish he would shut up
before the election.
If he would just stay quiet,
he'd get elected.""




 7:03


CA: And so, maybe for people on the left
there's a trap there,
to sort of despise
or just be baffled by the support,
assuming that it's for some
of the unattractive features.
Actually, maybe they're supporting
him despite those,
because they see something exciting.
They see a man of action.
They see the choking hold of government
being thrown off in some way
and they're excited by that.




 7:26


GC: But don't forget we saw that
on the left as well  Bernie Sanders.
So this is one of the commonalities
that I think we can talk about today,
""The Year of the Outsider,""
David  right?
And even though Bernie Sanders
has been in Congress for a long time,
he was deemed an outsider this time.
And so there was anger
on the left as well,
and so many people were in favor
of Bernie Sanders.
So I see it as a commonality.
People who like Trump,
people who like Bernie Sanders,
they were liking different policies,
but the underpinning was anger.




 8:00


CA: David, there's often
this narrative, then,
that the sole explanation
for Trump's victory and his rise
is his tapping into anger
in a very visceral way.
But you've written a bit about
that it's actually more than that,
that there's a worldview
that's being worked on here.
Could you talk about that?




 8:24


DB: I would say he understood what,
frankly, I didn't,
which is what debate we were having.
And so I'd grown up starting with Reagan,
and it was the big government
versus small government debate.
It was Barry Goldwater
versus George McGovern,
and that was the debate
we had been having for a generation.
It was: Democrats wanted to use
government to enhance equality,
Republicans wanted to limit government
to enhance freedom.
That was the debate.
He understood what I think
the two major parties did not,
which was that's not the debate anymore.
The debate is now open versus closed.
On one side are those who have
the tailwinds of globalization
and the meritocracy blowing at their back,
and they tend to favor open trade,
open borders, open social mores,
because there are so many opportunities.
On the other side are those
who feel the headwinds of globalization
and the meritocracy
just blasting in their faces,
and they favor closed trade,
closed borders, closed social mores,
because they just want some security.
And so he was right
on that fundamental issue,
and people were willing
to overlook a lot to get there.
And so he felt that sense of security.




 9:26


We're speaking the morning after
Trump's joint session speech.
There are three traditional
groups in the Republican Party.
There are the foreign policies hawks
who believe in America
as global policeman.
Trump totally repudiated that view.
Second, there was the social conservatives
who believed in religious liberty,
pro-life,
prayer in schools.
He totally ignored that.
There was not a single mention
of a single social conservative issue.
And then there were the fiscal hawks,
the people who wanted to cut down
on the national debt, Tea Party,
cut the size of government.
He's expanding the size of government!
Here's a man who has single-handedly
revolutionized a major American party
because he understood
where the debate was headed
before other people.
And then guys like Steve Bannon come in
and give him substance to his impulses.




10:15


CA: And so take that a bit further,
and maybe expand a bit more
on your insights
into Steve Bannon's worldview.
Because he's sometimes tarred
in very simple terms
as this dangerous, racist,
xenophobic, anger-sparking person.
There's more to the story;
that is perhaps an unfair simplification.




10:36


DB: I think that part is true,
but there's another part
that's probably true, too.
He's part of a global movement.
It's like being around Marxists in 1917.
There's him here, there's the UKIP party,
there's the National Front in France,
there's Putin, there's a Turkish version,
a Philippine version.
So we have to recognize that this
is a global intellectual movement.
And it believes
that wisdom and virtue is not held
in individual conversation and civility
the way a lot of us
in the enlightenment side of the world do.
It's held in  the German word
is the ""volk""  in the people,
in the common, instinctive wisdom
of the plain people.
And the essential virtue of that people
is always being threatened by outsiders.
And he's got a strategy
for how to get there.
He's got a series of policies
to bring the people up
and repudiate the outsiders,
whether those outsiders
are Islam, Mexicans, the media,
the coastal elites...
And there's a whole worldview there;
it's a very coherent worldview.
I sort of have more respect for him.
I loathe what he stands for
and I think he's wrong on the substance,
but it's interesting to see someone
with a set of ideas
find a vehicle, Donald Trump,
and then try to take control
of the White House
in order to advance his viewpoint.




11:53


CA: So it's almost become, like,
that the core question of our time now is:
Can you be patriotic
but also have a global mindset?
Are these two things
implacably opposed to each other?
I mean, a lot of conservatives
and, to the extent
that it's a different category,
a lot of Trump supporters,
are infuriated by the coastal elites
and the globalists
because they see them
as, sort of, not cheering for America,
not embracing fully American values.
I mean, have you seen that
in your conversations with people,
in your understanding of their mindset?




12:30


GC: I do think that there's
a huge difference between 
I hate to put people in categories, but,
Middle America versus
people who live on the coasts.
It's an entirely different existence.
And I grew up in Minnesota, so I have
an understanding of Middle America,
and I've never forgotten it.
And maybe that's why I have
an understanding of what happened here,
because those people often feel
like nobody's listening to them,
and that we're only concentrating
on California and New York.
And so I think that was a huge reason
why Trump was elected.
I mean, these people felt like
they were being heard.
Whether or not patriotism falls into that,
I'm not sure about that.
I do know one thing:
a lot of things Trump talked about
last night are not conservative things.
Had Hillary Clinton gotten up
and given that speech,
not one Republican would have
stood up to applaud.
I mean, he's talking about spending
a trillion dollars on infrastructure.
That is not a conservative viewpoint.
He talked about government-mandated
maternity leave.
A lot of women may love that;
it's not a conservative viewpoint.
So it's fascinating
that people who loved what his message
was during the campaign,
I'm not sure  how do you
think they'll react to that?




13:43


DB: I should say I grew up
in Lower Manhattan,
in the triangle between ABC Carpets,
the Strand Bookstore
and The Odeon restaurant.




13:50


(Laughter)




13:51


GC: Come to Minnesota sometime!




13:53


(Laughter)




13:54


CA: You are a card-carrying member
of the coastal elite, my man.
But what did you make
of the speech last night?
It seemed to be a move
to a more moderate position,
on the face of it.




14:07


DB: Yeah, I thought it
was his best speech,
and it took away the freakishness of him.
I do think he's a moral freak,
and I think he'll be undone by that fact,
the fact that he just doesn't know
anything about anything
and is uncurious about it.




14:20


(Laughter)




14:21


But if you take away these minor flaws,
I think we got to see him at his best,
and it was revealing for me
to see him at his best,
because to me, it exposed a central
contradiction that he's got to confront,
that a lot of what he's doing
is offering security.
So, ""I'm ordering closed borders,
I'm going to secure the world
for you, for my people.""
But then if you actually look
at a lot of his economic policies,
like health care reform, which is about
private health care accounts,
that's not security, that's risk.
Educational vouchers: that's risk.
Deregulation: that's risk.
There's really a contradiction
between the security of the mindset
and a lot of the policies,
which are very risk-oriented.
And what I would say, especially
having spent this year,
the people in rural Minnesota,
in New Mexico 
they've got enough risk in their lives.
And so they're going to say,
""No thank you.""
And I think his health care repeal
will fail for that reason.




15:18


CA: But despite the criticisms
you just made of him,
it does at least seem that he's listening
to a surprisingly wide range of voices;
it's not like everyone
is coming from the same place.
And maybe that leads to a certain
amount of chaos and confusion, but 




15:35


GC: I actually don't think he's listening
to a wide range of voices.
I think he's listening to very few people.
That's just my impression of it.
I believe that some of the things
he said last night
had Ivanka all over them.
So I believe he was listening
to her before that speech.
And he was Teleprompter Trump
last night, as opposed to Twitter Trump.
And that's why, before we came out here,
I said, ""We better check Twitter
to see if anything's changed.""
And also I think you have to keep in mind
that because he's such a unique character,
what was the bar that we
were expecting last night?
Was it here or here or here?
And so he comes out
and gives a looking political speech,
and everyone goes, ""Wow! He can do it.""
It just depends
on which direction he goes.




16:22


DB: Yeah, and we're trying
to build bridges here,
and especially for an audience
that may have contempt for Trump,
it's important to say,
no, this is a real thing.
But as I try my best to go an hour
showing respect for him,
my thyroid is surging,
because I think the oddities
of his character
really are condemnatory
and are going to doom him.




16:41


CA: Your reputation is as a conservative.
People would you describe you
as right of center,
and yet here you are
with this visceral reaction against him
and some of what he stands for.
I mean, I'm  how do you have
a conversation?
The people who support him,
on evidence so far,
are probably pretty excited.
He's certainly shown real engagement
in a lot of what he promised to do,
and there is a strong desire
to change the system radically.
People hate what government has become
and how it's left them out.




17:20


GC: I totally agree with that,
but I think that when he was proposing
a huge government program last night
that we used to call the bad s-word,
""stimulus,"" I find it completely ironic.
To spend a trillion dollars
on something 
that is not a conservative viewpoint.
Then again, I don't really believe
he's a Republican.




17:35


DB: And I would say, as someone
who identifies as conservative:
first of all,
to be conservative is to believe
in the limitations of politics.
Samuel Johnson said, ""Of all the things
that human hearts endure,
how few are those that kings
can cause and cure.""
Politics is a limited realm;
what matters most
is the moral nature of the society.
And so I have to think
character comes first,
and a man who doesn't pass
the character threshold
cannot be a good president.
Second, I'm the kind
of conservative who 
I harken back to Alexander Hamilton,
who was a Latino hip-hop star
from the heights 




18:07


(Laughter)




18:11


but his definition of America
was very future-oriented.
He was a poor boy from the islands
who had this rapid and amazing
rise to success,
and he wanted government to give
poor boys and girls like him
a chance to succeed,
using limited but energetic government
to create social mobility.
For him and for Lincoln
and for Teddy Roosevelt,
the idea of America
was the idea of the future.
We may have division and racism
and slavery in our past,
but we have a common future.
The definition of America that Steve
Bannon stands for is backwards-looking.
It's nostalgic; it's for the past.
And that is not traditionally
the American identity.
That's traditionally, frankly,
the Russian identity.
That's how they define virtue.
And so I think it is a fundamental
and foundational betrayal
of what conservatism used to stand for.




18:59


CA: Well, I'd like actually
like to hear from you,
and if we see some comments coming in
from some of you, we'll 
oh, well here's one right now.
Jeffrey Alan Carnegie: I've tried
to convince progressive friends
that they need to understand
what motivates Trump supporters,
yet many of them have given up
trying to understand
in the face of what they perceive
as lies, selfishness and hatred.
How would you reach out to such people,
the Tea Party of the left,
to try to bridge this divide?




19:24


GC: I actually think
there are commonalities in anger,
as I expressed earlier.
So I think you can come to the table,
both being passionate about something.
So at least you care.
And I would like to believe 
the c-word has also become
a horrible word  ""compromise,"" right?
So you have the far left
and the far right,
and compromise  forget it.
Those groups don't want
to even think about it.
But you have a huge swath
of voters, myself included,
who are registered independents,
like 40 percent of us, right?
So there is a huge faction of America
that wants to see change
and wants to see people come together.
It's just that we have to figure out
how to do that.




20:04


CA: So let's talk about that for a minute,
because we're having these TED Dialogues,
we're trying to bridge.
There's a lot of people out there,
right now, perhaps especially on the left,
who think this is a terrible idea,
that actually, the only moral response
to the great tyranny
that may be about to emerge in America
is to resist it at every stage,
is to fight it tooth and nail,
it's a mistake to try and do this.
Just fight!
Is there a case for that?




20:35


DB: It depends what ""fight"" means.
If it means literal fighting, then no.
If it means marching, well maybe
marching to raise consciousness,
that seems fine.
But if you want change in this country,
we do it through parties and politics.
We organize parties, and those parties
are big, diverse, messy coalitions,
and we engage in politics,
and politics is always
morally unsatisfying
because it's always
a bunch of compromises.
But politics is essentially
a competition between partial truths.
The Trump people have a piece
of the truth in America.
I think Trump himself is the wrong answer
to the right question,
but they have some truth,
and it's truth found in the epidemic
of opiates around the country,
it's truth found in
the spread of loneliness,
it's the truth found in people
whose lives are inverted.
They peaked professionally at age 30,
and it's all been downhill since.
And so, understanding that
doesn't take fighting,
it takes conversation and then asking,
""What are we going to replace Trump with?""




21:31


GC: But you saw fighting last night,
even at the speech,
because you saw the Democratic women
who came and wore white
to honor the suffragette movement.
I remember back during the campaign
where some Trump supporters wanted
to actually get rid of the amendment
that allowed us to vote as women.
It was like, what?
So I don't know if
that's the right way to fight.
It was interesting,
because I was looking in the audience,
trying to see Democratic women
who didn't wear white.
So there's a lot going on there,
and there's a lot of ways to fight
that are not necessarily doing that.




22:04


CA: I mean, one of the key
questions, to me, is:
The people who voted for Trump
but, if you like, are more in the center,
like they're possibly
amenable to persuasion 
are they more likely to be persuaded
by seeing a passionate uprising
of people saying, ""No, no, no, you can't!""
or will that actually piss them off
and push them away?




22:29


DB: How are any of us persuaded?
Am I going to persuade you by saying,
""Well, you're kind of a bigot,
you're supporting bigotry,
you're supporting sexism.
You're a primitive, fascistic rise
from some authoritarian past""?
That's probably not going to be
too persuasive to you.
And so the way any of us
are persuaded is by:
a) some basic show of respect
for the point of view, and saying,
""I think this guy is not going
to get you where you need to go.""
And there are two phrases
you've heard over and over again,
wherever you go in the country.
One, the phrase ""flyover country.""
And that's been heard for years,
but I would say this year,
I heard it almost on an hourly basis,
a sense of feeling invisible.
And then the sense a sense of the phrase
""political correctness.""
Just that rebellion: ""They're not even
letting us say what we think.""
And I teach at Yale.
The narrowing of debate is real.




23:23


CA: So you would say this is a trap
that liberals have fallen into
by celebrating causes
they really believe in,
often expressed through the language
of ""political correctness.""
They have done damage.
They have pushed people away.




23:38


DB: I would say
a lot of the argument, though,
with ""descent to fascism,""
""authoritarianism"" 
that just feels over-the-top to people.
And listen, I've written
eight million anti-Trump columns,
but it is a problem, especially
for the coastal media,
that every time he does something
slightly wrong, we go to 11,
and we're at 11 every day.
And it just strains
credibility at some point.




23:59


CA: Crying wolf a little too loud
and a little too early.
But there may be a time
when we really do have to cry wolf.




24:05


GC: But see  one of the most
important things to me
is how the conservative media
handles Trump.
Will they call him out
when things are not true,
or will they just go along with it?
To me, that is what is essential
in this entire discussion,
because when you have
followers of somebody
who don't really care
if he tells the truth or not,
that can be very dangerous.
So to me, it's: How is the conservative
media going to respond to it?
I mean, you've been calling them out.
But how will other forms
of conservative media deal with that
as we move forward?




24:45


DB: It's all shifted, though.
The conservative media used to be Fox
or Charles Krauthammer or George Will.
They're no longer the conservative media.
Now there's another whole set
of institutions further right,
which is Breitbart and Infowars,
Alex Jones, Laura Ingraham,
and so they're the ones who are now
his base, not even so much Fox.




25:04


CA: My last question for the time being
is just on this question of the truth.
I mean, it's one of the scariest
things to people right now,
that there is no agreement,
nationally, on what is true.
I've never seen anything like it,
where facts are so massively disputed.
Your whole newspaper, sir,
is delivering fake news every day.




25:24


DB: And failing.




25:25


(Laughter)




25:26


CA: And failing. My commiserations.
But is there any path
whereby we can start to get
some kind of consensus,
to believe the same things?
Can online communities play a role here?
How do we fix this?




25:46


GC: See, I understand how that happened.
That's another groundswell kind of emotion
that was going on in the middle of America
and not being heard,
in thinking that the mainstream
media was biased.
There's a difference, though,
between being biased and being fake.
To me, that is a very important
distinction in this conversation.
So let's just say that there was some bias
in the mainstream media.
OK. So there are ways
to try and mend that.
But what Trump's doing
is nuclearizing that and saying,
""Look, we're just going to call
all of that fake.""
That's where it gets dangerous.




26:20


CA: Do you think enough of his supporters
have a greater loyalty
to the truth than to any ...
Like, the principle
of not supporting something
that is demonstrably not true
actually matters, so there will be
a correction at some point?




26:37


DB: I think the truth
eventually comes out.
So for example, Donald Trump
has based a lot of his economic policy
on this supposition that Americans
have lost manufacturing jobs
because they've been stolen
by the Chinese.
That is maybe 13 percent
of the jobs that left.
The truth is that 87 percent of the jobs
were replaced by technology.
That is just the truth.
And so as a result, when he says,
""I'm going to close TPP
and all the jobs will come roaring back,""
they will not come roaring back.
So that is an actual fact, in my belief.
And 




27:08


(Laughter)




27:10


GC: But I'm saying what
his supporters think is the truth,
no matter how many times
you might say that,
they still believe him.




27:16


DB: But eventually either jobs
will come back or they will not come back,
and at that point, either something
will work or it doesn't work,
and it doesn't work or not work
because of great marketing,
it works because it actually
addresses a real problem
and so I happen to think
the truth will out.




27:31


CA: If you've got a question,
please raise your hand here.




27:35


Yael Eisenstat: I'll speak into the box.
My name's Yael Eisenstat.
I hear a lot of this talk
about how we all need to start
talking to each other more
and understanding each other more,
and I've even written about this,
published on this subject as well,
but now today I keep hearing liberals 
yes, I live in New York,
I can be considered a liberal 
we sit here and self-analyze:
What did we do to not understand
the Rust Belt?
Or: What can we do to understand
Middle America better?
And what I'd like to know:
Have you seen any attempts
or conversations from Middle America
of what can I do to understand
the so-called coastal elites better?
Because I'm just offended
as being put in a box as a coastal elite
as someone in Middle America is
as being considered a flyover state
and not listened to.




28:21


CA: There you go, I can hear Facebook
cheering as you 




28:24


(Laughter)




28:25


DB: I would say  and this is someone
who has been conservative
all my adult life 
when you grow up conservative,
you learn to speak both languages.
Because if I'm going to listen to music,
I'm not going to listen to Ted Nugent.
So a lot of my favorite rock bands
are all on the left.
If I'm going to go to a school,
I'm going probably to school
where the culture is liberal.
If I'm going to watch a sitcom
or a late-night comedy show,
it's going to be liberal.
If I'm going to read a good newspaper,
it'll be the New York Times.
As a result, you learn
to speak both languages.
And that actually, at least
for a number of years,
when I started at National Review
with William F. Buckley,
it made us sharper,
because we were used to arguing
against people every day.
The problem now that's happened
is you have ghettoization on the right
and you can live entirely in rightworld,
so as a result, the quality of argument
on the right has diminished,
because you're not in the other side
all the time.
But I do think if you're living
in Minnesota or Iowa or Arizona,
the coastal elites
make themselves aware to you,
so you know that language as well,
but it's not the reverse.




29:32


CA: But what does Middle America
not get about coastal elites?
So the critique is,
you are not dealing
with the real problems.
There's a feeling of a snobbishness,
an elitism that is very off-putting.
What are they missing?
If you could plant one piece of truth
from the mindset of someone
in this room, for example,
what would you say to them?




30:01


DB: Just how insanely wonderful we are.




30:03


(Laughter)




30:05


No, I reject the category.
The problem with populism
is the same problem with elitism.
It's just a prejudice on the basis
of probably an over-generalized 
social class distinction
which is too simplistic
to apply in reality.
Those of us in New York know
there are some people in New York
who are completely awesome,
and some people who are pathetic,
and if you live in Iowa, some people
are awesome and some people are pathetic.
It's not a question
of what degree you have
or where you happen to live
in the country.
The distinction is just a crude
simplification to arouse political power.




30:37


GC: But I would encourage people
to watch a television news show
or read a column
that they normally wouldn't.
So if you are a Trump supporter,
watch the other side for a day,
because you need to come out of the bubble
if you're ever going
to have a conversation.
And both sides  so if you're a liberal,
then watch something
that's very conservative.
Read a column that is not something
you would normally read,
because then you gain perspective
of what the other side is thinking,
and to me, that's a start
of coming together.
I worry about the same thing
you worry about, these bubbles.
I think if you only watch
certain entities,
you have no idea what the rest
of the world is talking about.




31:17


DB: I think not only watching,
being part of an organization
that meets at least once a month
that puts you in direct contact
with people completely unlike yourself
is something we all have
a responsibility for.
I may get this a little wrong,
but I think of the top-selling
automotive models in this country,
I think the top three or four
are all pickup trucks.
So ask yourself: How many people
do I know who own a pickup truck?
And it could be very few or zero
for a lot of people.
And that's sort of a warning sign
kind of a problem.
Where can I join a club
where I'll have a lot in common
with a person who drives a pickup truck
because we have a common
interest in whatever?




31:54


CA: And so the internet is definitely
contributing to this.
A question here from Chris Ajemian:
""How do you feel structure
of communications,
especially the prevalence of social
media and individualized content,
can be used to bring together
a political divide,
instead of just filing communities
into echo chambers?""
I mean, it looks like Facebook
and Google, since the election,
are working hard on this question.
They're trying to change the algorithms
so that they don't amplify fake news
to the extent that it happened
last time round.
Do you see any other
promising signs of ...?




32:29


GC: ... or amplify one side
of the equation.




32:31


CA: Exactly.




32:32


GC: I think that was the constant
argument from the right,
that social media
and the internet in general
was putting articles towards the",Transcript extended into text file

In this delightful, hilarious talk, data journalist Mona Chalabi shares handy tips to help question, interpret and truly understand what the numbers are saying.",http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/2711/transcript?language=en,2,2017,TEDNYC,0:11:45,3/24/17,1091619,"politics,math,journalism,funny,storytelling,education,social change,society,art,communication,statistics,visualizations,data","0:11


I'm going to be talking
about statistics today.
If that makes you immediately feel
a little bit wary, that's OK,
that doesn't make you some
kind of crazy conspiracy theorist,
it makes you skeptical.
And when it comes to numbers,
especially now, you should be skeptical.
But you should also be able to tell
which numbers are reliable
and which ones aren't.
So today I want to try to give you
some tools to be able to do that.
But before I do,
I just want to clarify which numbers
I'm talking about here.
I'm not talking about claims like,
""9 out of 10 women recommend
this anti-aging cream.""
I think a lot of us always
roll our eyes at numbers like that.
What's different now is people
are questioning statistics like,
""The US unemployment
rate is five percent.""
What makes this claim different is
it doesn't come from a private company,
it comes from the government.




 0:54


About 4 out of 10 Americans
distrust the economic data
that gets reported by government.
Among supporters of President Trump
it's even higher;
it's about 7 out of 10.
I don't need to tell anyone here
that there are a lot of dividing lines
in our society right now,
and a lot of them start to make sense,
once you understand people's relationships
with these government numbers.
On the one hand, there are those who say
these statistics are crucial,
that we need them to make sense
of society as a whole
in order to move beyond
emotional anecdotes
and measure progress
in an [objective] way.
And then there are the others,
who say that these statistics are elitist,
maybe even rigged;
they don't make sense
and they don't really reflect
what's happening
in people's everyday lives.




 1:34


It kind of feels like that second group
is winning the argument right now.
We're living in a world
of alternative facts,
where people don't find statistics
this kind of common ground,
this starting point for debate.
This is a problem.
There are actually
moves in the US right now
to get rid of some government
statistics altogether.
Right now there's a bill in congress
about measuring racial inequality.
The draft law says that government
money should not be used
to collect data on racial segregation.
This is a total disaster.
If we don't have this data,
how can we observe discrimination,
let alone fix it?
In other words:
How can a government create fair policies
if they can't measure
current levels of unfairness?
This isn't just about discrimination,
it's everything  think about it.
How can we legislate on health care
if we don't have good data
on health or poverty?
How can we have public debate
about immigration
if we can't at least agree
on how many people are entering
and leaving the country?
Statistics come from the state;
that's where they got their name.
The point was to better
measure the population
in order to better serve it.
So we need these government numbers,
but we also have to move
beyond either blindly accepting
or blindly rejecting them.
We need to learn the skills
to be able to spot bad statistics.




 2:41


I started to learn some of these
when I was working
in a statistical department
that's part of the United Nations.
Our job was to find out how many Iraqis
had been forced from their homes
as a result of the war,
and what they needed.
It was really important work,
but it was also incredibly difficult.
Every single day, we were making decisions
that affected the accuracy
of our numbers 
decisions like which parts
of the country we should go to,
who we should speak to,
which questions we should ask.
And I started to feel
really disillusioned with our work,
because we thought we were doing
a really good job,
but the one group of people
who could really tell us were the Iraqis,
and they rarely got the chance to find
our analysis, let alone question it.
So I started to feel really determined
that the one way to make
numbers more accurate
is to have as many people as possible
be able to question them.




 3:24


So I became a data journalist.
My job is finding these data sets
and sharing them with the public.
Anyone can do this,
you don't have to be a geek or a nerd.
You can ignore those words;
they're used by people
trying to say they're smart
while pretending they're humble.
Absolutely anyone can do this.




 3:40


I want to give you guys three questions
that will help you be able to spot
some bad statistics.
So, question number one
is: Can you see uncertainty?
One of things that's really changed
people's relationship with numbers,
and even their trust in the media,
has been the use of political polls.
I personally have a lot of issues
with political polls
because I think the role of journalists
is actually to report the facts
and not attempt to predict them,
especially when those predictions
can actually damage democracy
by signaling to people:
don't bother to vote for that guy,
he doesn't have a chance.
Let's set that aside for now and talk
about the accuracy of this endeavor.




 4:14


Based on national elections
in the UK, Italy, Israel
and of course, the most recent
US presidential election,
using polls to predict electoral outcomes
is about as accurate as using the moon
to predict hospital admissions.
No, seriously, I used actual data
from an academic study to draw this.
There are a lot of reasons why
polling has become so inaccurate.
Our societies have become really diverse,
which makes it difficult for pollsters
to get a really nice representative sample
of the population for their polls.
People are really reluctant to answer
their phones to pollsters,
and also, shockingly enough,
people might lie.
But you wouldn't necessarily
know that to look at the media.
For one thing, the probability
of a Hillary Clinton win
was communicated with decimal places.
We don't use decimal places
to describe the temperature.
How on earth can predicting the behavior
of 230 million voters in this country
be that precise?
And then there were those sleek charts.
See, a lot of data visualizations
will overstate certainty, and it works 
these charts can numb
our brains to criticism.
When you hear a statistic,
you might feel skeptical.
As soon as it's buried in a chart,
it feels like some kind
of objective science,
and it's not.




 5:21


So I was trying to find ways
to better communicate this to people,
to show people the uncertainty
in our numbers.
What I did was I started taking
real data sets,
and turning them into
hand-drawn visualizations,
so that people can see
how imprecise the data is;
so people can see that a human did this,
a human found the data and visualized it.
For example, instead
of finding out the probability
of getting the flu in any given month,
you can see the rough
distribution of flu season.
This is 




 5:48


(Laughter)




 5:49


a bad shot to show in February.
But it's also more responsible
data visualization,
because if you were to show
the exact probabilities,
maybe that would encourage
people to get their flu jabs
at the wrong time.




 6:00


The point of these shaky lines
is so that people remember
these imprecisions,
but also so they don't necessarily
walk away with a specific number,
but they can remember important facts.
Facts like injustice and inequality
leave a huge mark on our lives.
Facts like Black Americans and Native
Americans have shorter life expectancies
than those of other races,
and that isn't changing anytime soon.
Facts like prisoners in the US
can be kept in solitary confinement cells
that are smaller than the size
of an average parking space.




 6:29


The point of these visualizations
is also to remind people
of some really important
statistical concepts,
concepts like averages.
So let's say you hear a claim like,
""The average swimming pool in the US
contains 6.23 fecal accidents.""
That doesn't mean every single
swimming pool in the country
contains exactly 6.23 turds.
So in order to show that,
I went back to the original data,
which comes from the CDC,
who surveyed 47 swimming facilities.
And I just spent one evening
redistributing poop.
So you can kind of see
how misleading averages can be.




 6:59


(Laughter)




 7:00


OK, so the second question
that you guys should be asking yourselves
to spot bad numbers is:
Can I see myself in the data?
This question is also
about averages in a way,
because part of the reason
why people are so frustrated
with these national statistics,
is they don't really tell the story
of who's winning and who's losing
from national policy.
It's easy to understand why people
are frustrated with global averages
when they don't match up
with their personal experiences.
I wanted to show people the way
data relates to their everyday lives.
I started this advice column
called ""Dear Mona,""
where people would write to me
with questions and concerns
and I'd try to answer them with data.
People asked me anything.
questions like, ""Is it normal to sleep
in a separate bed to my wife?""
""Do people regret their tattoos?""
""What does it mean to die
of natural causes?""




 7:44


All of these questions are great,
because they make you think
about ways to find
and communicate these numbers.
If someone asks you,
""How much pee is a lot of pee?""
which is a question that I got asked,
you really want to make sure
that the visualization makes sense
to as many people as possible.
These numbers aren't unavailable.
Sometimes they're just buried
in the appendix of an academic study.
And they're certainly not inscrutable;
if you really wanted to test
these numbers on urination volume,
you could grab a bottle
and try it for yourself.




 8:11


(Laughter)




 8:12


The point of this isn't necessarily
that every single data set
has to relate specifically to you.
I'm interested in how many women
were issued fines in France
for wearing the face veil, or the niqab,
even if I don't live in France
or wear the face veil.
The point of asking where you fit in
is to get as much context as possible.
So it's about zooming out
from one data point,
like the unemployment rate
is five percent,
and seeing how it changes over time,
or seeing how it changes
by educational status 
this is why your parents always
wanted you to go to college 
or seeing how it varies by gender.
Nowadays, male unemployment rate is higher
than the female unemployment rate.
Up until the early '80s,
it was the other way around.
This is a story of one
of the biggest changes
that's happened in American society,
and it's all there in that chart,
once you look beyond the averages.
The axes are everything;
once you change the scale,
you can change the story.




 9:00


OK, so the third and final question
that I want you guys to think about
when you're looking at statistics is:
How was the data collected?
So far, I've only talked about the way
data is communicated,
but the way it's collected
matters just as much.
I know this is tough,
because methodologies can be opaque
and actually kind of boring,
but there are some simple steps
you can take to check this.




 9:21


I'll use one last example here.
One poll found that 41 percent of Muslims
in this country support jihad,
which is obviously pretty scary,
and it was reported everywhere in 2015.
When I want to check a number like that,
I'll start off by finding
the original questionnaire.
It turns out that journalists
who reported on that statistic
ignored a question
lower down on the survey
that asked respondents
how they defined ""jihad.""
And most of them defined it as,
""Muslims' personal, peaceful struggle
to be more religious.""
Only 16 percent defined it as,
""violent holy war against unbelievers.""
This is the really important point:
based on those numbers,
it's totally possible
that no one in the survey
who defined it as violent holy war
also said they support it.
Those two groups might not overlap at all.




10:06


It's also worth asking
how the survey was carried out.
This was something called an opt-in poll,
which means anyone could have found it
on the internet and completed it.
There's no way of knowing
if those people even identified as Muslim.
And finally, there were 600
respondents in that poll.
There are roughly three million
Muslims in this country,
according to Pew Research Center.
That means the poll spoke to roughly
one in every 5,000 Muslims
in this country.




10:28


This is one of the reasons
why government statistics
are often better than private statistics.
A poll might speak to a couple
hundred people, maybe a thousand,
or if you're L'Oreal, trying to sell
skin care products in 2005,
then you spoke to 48 women
to claim that they work.




10:42


(Laughter)




10:43


Private companies don't have a huge
interest in getting the numbers right,
they just need the right numbers.
Government statisticians aren't like that.
In theory, at least,
they're totally impartial,
not least because most of them do
their jobs regardless of who's in power.
They're civil servants.
And to do their jobs properly,
they don't just speak
to a couple hundred people.
Those unemployment numbers
I keep on referencing
come from the Bureau of Labor Statistics,
and to make their estimates,
they speak to over 140,000
businesses in this country.




11:11


I get it, it's frustrating.
If you want to test a statistic
that comes from a private company,
you can buy the face cream for you
and a bunch of friends, test it out,
if it doesn't work,
you can say the numbers were wrong.
But how do you question
government statistics?
You just keep checking everything.
Find out how they collected the numbers.
Find out if you're seeing everything
on the chart you need to see.
But don't give up on the numbers
altogether, because if you do,
we'll be making public policy
decisions in the dark,
using nothing but private
interests to guide us.




11:39


Thank you.

This is what my last week looked like.
What I did,
who I was with,
the main sensations I had
for every waking hour ...
If the feeling came as I thought of my dad
who recently passed away,
or if I could have just definitely
avoided the worries and anxieties.
And if you think I'm a little obsessive,
you're probably right.
But clearly, from this visualization,
you can learn much more about me
than from this other one,
which are images you're
probably more familiar with
and which you possibly even have
on your phone right now.
Bar charts for the steps you walked,
pie charts for the quality
of your sleep 
the path of your morning runs.




 0:54


In my day job, I work with data.
I run a data visualization design company,
and we design and develop ways
to make information accessible
through visual representations.
What my job has taught me over the years
is that to really understand data
and their true potential,
sometimes we actually
have to forget about them
and see through them instead.
Because data are always
just a tool we use to represent reality.
They're always used
as a placeholder for something else,
but they are never the real thing.




 1:26


But let me step back for a moment
to when I first understood
this personally.
In 1994, I was 13 years old.
I was a teenager in Italy.
I was too young
to be interested in politics,
but I knew that a businessman,
Silvio Berlusconi,
was running for president
for the moderate right.
We lived in a very liberal town,
and my father was a politician
for the Democratic Party.
And I remember that no one thought
that Berlusconi could get elected 
that was totally not an option.
But it happened.
And I remember the feeling very vividly.
It was a complete surprise,
as my dad promised that in my town
he knew nobody who voted for him.




 2:09


This was the first time
when the data I had gave me
a completely distorted image of reality.
My data sample was actually
pretty limited and skewed,
so probably it was because of that,
I thought, I lived in a bubble,
and I didn't have enough chances
to see outside of it.




 2:27


Now, fast-forward to November 8, 2016
in the United States.
The internet polls,
statistical models,
all the pundits agreeing on a possible
outcome for the presidential election.
It looked like we had
enough information this time,
and many more chances to see outside
the closed circle we lived in 
but we clearly didn't.
The feeling felt very familiar.
I had been there before.
I think it's fair to say
the data failed us this time 
and pretty spectacularly.
We believed in data,
but what happened,
even with the most respected newspaper,
is that the obsession to reduce everything
to two simple percentage numbers
to make a powerful headline
made us focus on these two digits
and them alone.
In an effort to simplify the message
and draw a beautiful,
inevitable red and blue map,
we lost the point completely.
We somehow forgot
that there were stories 
stories of human beings
behind these numbers.




 3:28


In a different context,
but to a very similar point,
a peculiar challenge was presented
to my team by this woman.
She came to us with a lot of data,
but ultimately she wanted to tell
one of the most humane stories possible.
She's Samantha Cristoforetti.
She has been the first
Italian woman astronaut,
and she contacted us before being launched
on a six-month-long expedition
to the International Space Station.
She told us, ""I'm going to space,
and I want to do something meaningful
with the data of my mission
to reach out to people.""
A mission to the
International Space Station
comes with terabytes of data
about anything you can possibly imagine 
the orbits around Earth,
the speed and position of the ISS
and all of the other thousands
of live streams from its sensors.
We had all of the hard data
we could think of 
just like the pundits
before the election 
but what is the point
of all these numbers?
People are not interested
in data for the sake of it,
because numbers are never the point.
They're always the means to an end.
The story we needed to tell
is that there is a human being
in a teeny box
flying in space above your head,
and that you can actually see her
with your naked eye on a clear night.
So we decided to use data
to create a connection
between Samantha and all of the people
looking at her from below.
We designed and developed
what we called ""Friends in Space,""
a web application that simply
lets you say ""hello"" to Samantha
from where you are,
and ""hello"" to all the people
who are online at the same time
from all over the world.
And all of these ""hellos""
left visible marks on the map
as Samantha was flying by
and as she was actually
waving back every day at us
using Twitter from the ISS.




 5:15


This made people see the mission's data
from a very different perspective.
It all suddenly became much more
about our human nature and our curiosity,
rather than technology.
So data powered the experience,
but stories of human beings
were the drive.
The very positive response
of its thousands of users
taught me a very important lesson 
that working with data
means designing ways
to transform the abstract
and the uncountable
into something that can be seen,
felt and directly reconnected
to our lives and to our behaviors,
something that is hard to achieve
if we let the obsession for the numbers
and the technology around them
lead us in the process.
But we can do even more to connect data
to the stories they represent.
We can remove technology completely.




 6:07


A few years ago, I met this other woman,
Stefanie Posavec 
a London-based designer who shares with me
the passion and obsession about data.
We didn't know each other,
but we decided to run
a very radical experiment,
starting a communication using only data,
no other language,
and we opted for using no technology
whatsoever to share our data.
In fact, our only means of communication
would be through
the old-fashioned post office.
For ""Dear Data,"" every week for one year,
we used our personal data
to get to know each other 
personal data around weekly
shared mundane topics,
from our feelings
to the interactions with our partners,
from the compliments we received
to the sounds of our surroundings.
Personal information
that we would then manually hand draw
on a postcard-size sheet of paper
that we would every week
send from London to New York,
where I live,
and from New York to London,
where she lives.
The front of the postcard
is the data drawing,
and the back of the card
contains the address
of the other person, of course,
and the legend for how
to interpret our drawing.
The very first week into the project,
we actually chose
a pretty cold and impersonal topic.
How many times do we
check the time in a week?
So here is the front of my card,
and you can see that every little symbol
represents all of the times
that I checked the time,
positioned for days
and different hours chronologically 
nothing really complicated here.
But then you see in the legend
how I added anecdotal details
about these moments.
In fact, the different types of symbols
indicate why I was checking the time 
what was I doing?
Was I bored? Was I hungry?
Was I late?
Did I check it on purpose
or just casually glance at the clock?
And this is the key part 
representing the details
of my days and my personality
through my data collection.
Using data as a lens or a filter
to discover and reveal, for example,
my never-ending anxiety for being late,
even though I'm absolutely always on time.




 8:15


Stefanie and I spent one year
collecting our data manually
to force us to focus on the nuances
that computers cannot gather 
or at least not yet 
using data also to explore our minds
and the words we use,
and not only our activities.
Like at week number three,
where we tracked the ""thank yous""
we said and were received,
and when I realized that I thank
mostly people that I don't know.
Apparently I'm a compulsive thanker
to waitresses and waiters,
but I definitely don't thank enough
the people who are close to me.




 8:50


Over one year,
the process of actively noticing
and counting these types of actions
became a ritual.
It actually changed ourselves.
We became much more
in tune with ourselves,
much more aware of our behaviors
and our surroundings.
Over one year, Stefanie and I
connected at a very deep level
through our shared data diary,
but we could do this only because
we put ourselves in these numbers,
adding the contexts
of our very personal stories to them.
It was the only way
to make them truly meaningful
and representative of ourselves.




 9:25


I am not asking you
to start drawing your personal data,
or to find a pen pal across the ocean.
But I'm asking you to consider data 
all kind of data 
as the beginning of the conversation
and not the end.
Because data alone
will never give us a solution.
And this is why data failed us so badly 
because we failed to include
the right amount of context
to represent reality 
a nuanced, complicated
and intricate reality.
We kept looking at these two numbers,
obsessing with them
and pretending that our world
could be reduced
to a couple digits and a horse race,
while the real stories,
the ones that really mattered,
were somewhere else.




10:07


What we missed looking at these stories
only through models and algorithms
is what I call ""data humanism.""
In the Renaissance humanism,
European intellectuals
placed the human nature instead of God
at the center of their view of the world.
I believe something similar
needs to happen
with the universe of data.
Now data are apparently
treated like a God 
keeper of infallible truth
for our present and our future.




10:34


The experiences
that I shared with you today
taught me that to make data faithfully
representative of our human nature
and to make sure they will not
mislead us anymore,
we need to start designing ways
to include empathy, imperfection
and human qualities
in how we collect, process,
analyze and display them.
I do see a place where, ultimately,
instead of using data
only to become more efficient,
we will all use data
to become more humane.

Thank you.

Artist and first-aid enthusiast Todd Scott breaks down what you need to know about using an automated external defibrillator, or AED -- in this galaxy and ones that are far, far away. Prepare to save the life of a Jedi, Chewbacca (he'll need a quick shave first) or someone else in need with some helpful pointers.",http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/2726/transcript?language=en,1,2017,TEDNYC,0:05:22,4/12/17,717366,"entertainment,heart health,education,teaching,health,society","0:11


Last year, I got a chance to watch
the new ""Star Wars"" movie,
which was fantastic,
but one thing kept bugging me.
I don't know if you noticed this or not.
In this entirely technically
advanced world,
I did not see a single AED anywhere,
which was totally shocking 
almost as shocking
as not knowing what an AED is,
which you guys do know.
But for those at home,
an AED is an automated
external defibrillator.
It's the device you use
when your heart goes into cardiac arrest
to shock it back into a normal rhythm,
or, as one of the guys I was teaching
a class to referred to it as:
""The shocky-hearty-box thing.""




 0:43


(Laughter)




 0:44


But I really can't blame the Empire,
since health and safety regulations
aren't really their first
order of business.
Though, even if we 
I think worse than not having an AED
would be if there was one there,
but just, no one knew where to find it.
These devices can drastically increase
your chance of survival 
almost like a tauntaun on Hoth.




 1:05


(Laughter)




 1:06


But I'm pretty sure
that stormtrooper is going to be toast,
regardless if we have an AED or not,
since what happens is the chest plate
is going to be quite hard to get off,
and like that tauntaun,
the AED has a very short window of time
at which it's highly effective.
In this case  basically, we've got
to use it within the first 10 minutes.




 1:25


The Jedi, on the other hand,
have no problems with their outfits.
Those robes open straight up,
you can place the pads
right onto the chest 
so upper-right-hand side of the chest,
lower left,
wait for the unit to determine
if it's a shockable rhythm
and get ready to shock.
But, the Jedi do have a problem.
They have a head appendage issue.
And so I can be totally clear,
thinking I'm ready to go,
but I'm accidentally touching a tentacle
and inadvertently shocking myself.




 1:51


(Laughter)




 1:53


So before you hit that button,
make sure you are clear
and everyone else is clear.




 1:59


Going back to that stormtrooper:
If I did get that chest plate off in time,
what would you do if you suddenly found
there was a Wookiee under there,
or possibly two Ewoks?




 2:10


(Laughter)




 2:12


Well, lucky for us,
in the kit there's actually a razor,
and we can use that to shave the chest
on the upper right-hand side
and the lower left.




 2:21


Wookiees also have another problem.
They have an accessory issue.
What we want to do is remove these 
anything between the two pads
we want to remove,
since it can cause
something called ""arcing.""
For those who don't know what arcing is,
do you remember the Emperor,
when he shoots electricity
out the ends of his fingers 




 2:39


(Laughter)




 2:40


that would be kind of like arcing.
Another thing that 
Oh! By the way, he creates that
by wearing wool socks under his robes.




 2:46


(Laughter)




 2:47


We can also get arcing if we have
an extremely wet chest.
The electricity travels across the surface
instead of through the heart.
We can correct this with the immortal
words of Douglas Adams:
""Don't panic,"" which most of us
have done today 
and also always having a towel.
So, good words to go by.




 3:04


The metal bikini  unfortunately,
this is where panic sets in 
like the modern bra,
we have to make sure we remove,
because this can cause
severe arcing along with burns.
But unfortunately this opens up an issue
that's almost as controversial
as talking about the prequels.




 3:21


(Laughter)




 3:22


The mere mention of the word ""nipples,""
and people get into a little
bit of a tizzy.
By the way, that is not a nipple,
that's a cupcake.




 3:29


(Laughter)




 3:31


Chances are, if you do have to use this,
this is going to be on someone you know.
And remember, everyone has nipples,
except for Jabba.




 3:39


(Laughter)




 3:40


But he does love cupcakes.
Speaking about Jabba,
if we do have to use an AED on him,
remember pad placement is the same,
even though he doesn't have nipples.
So it's going to be
upper right-hand side, lower left.
If we were going through, we're shocking,
getting ready to go 
after we've done the shock,
one of the things we need to do
is remember to do compression.
The preferred method
is 30 compressions and two breaths
in the center of the chest,
between the nipples,
pressing down at least two inches,
no more than two and a half,
at a rate of at least 100 beats a minute,
no more than 120.
Unfortunately, due to the size
of Jabba's mouth
and also what he puts in said mouth,
we may not want to actually
do the mouth-to-mouth part.
So instead, we can do
compression-only CPR.
The way of remembering
the compression-only part
is we can actually use the Imperial March.




 4:33


I would sing it for you 




 4:35


(Laughter)




 4:37


Unfortunately, that would be more
something an interrogation droid would do.




 4:42


Yoda.
Small little guy, like a baby.
What we do is basically
treat him like a baby,
in the sense that we're going to place
one pad in the center of the chest
and one in the back.
If we place them both in the front,
they can be too close
and cause severe arcing,
so we want to avoid that.




 4:58


Hopefully, this helped to clarify
and put some light
on some of the darker issues
of using an AED in the Star Wars universe,
or any universe in total.




 5:06


I'll leave you with one point.
Remember, if you do find yourself
dealing with a Wookiee,
do not shave the entire Wookiee.
This takes way too much time,
and it only pisses them off.




 5:15


(Laughter)




 5:16


Thank you very much.

Twenty years ago,
when I was a barrister
and human rights lawyer
in full-time legal practice in London,
and the highest court in the land
still convened, some would say
by an accident of history,
in this building here,
I met a young man
who had just quit his job
in the British Foreign Office.
When I asked him, ""Why did you leave,""
he told me this story.




 0:37


He had gone to his boss
one morning and said,
""Let's do something
about human rights abuses in China.""
And his boss had replied,
""We can't do anything
about human rights abuses in China
because we have
trade relations with China.""




 0:53


So my friend went away
with his tail between his legs,
and six months later,
he returned again to his boss,
and he said this time,
""Let's do something
about human rights in Burma,""
as it was then called.




 1:07


His boss once again paused
and said, ""Oh, but we can't
do anything about human rights in Burma
because we don't have
any trade relations with Burma.""




 1:17


(Laughter)




 1:18


This was the moment
he knew he had to leave.
It wasn't just the hypocrisy
that got to him.
It was the unwillingness of his government
to engage in conflict
with other governments,
in tense discussions,
all the while, innocent people
were being harmed.




 1:36


We are constantly told
that conflict is bad
that compromise is good;
that conflict is bad
but consensus is good;
that conflict is bad
and collaboration is good.
But in my view,
that's far too simple
a vision of the world.
We cannot know
whether conflict is bad
unless we know who is fighting,
why they are fighting
and how they are fighting.
And compromises can be thoroughly rotten
if they harm people
who are not at the table,
people who are vulnerable, disempowered,
people whom we have
an obligation to protect.




 2:23


Now, you might be
somewhat skeptical of a lawyer
arguing about the benefits of conflict
and creating problems for compromise,
but I did also qualify as a mediator,
and these days, I spend my time
giving talks about ethics for free.
So as my bank manager likes to remind me,
I'm downwardly mobile.
But if you accept my argument,
it should change not just the way
we lead our personal lives,
which I wish to put
to one side for the moment,
but it will change the way
we think about major problems
of public health and the environment.
Let me explain.




 3:03


Every middle schooler
in the United States,
my 12-year-old daughter included,
learns that there are
three branches of government,
the legislative, the executive
and the judicial branch.
James Madison wrote,
""If there is any principle
more sacred in our Constitution,
and indeed in any free constitution,
than any other,
it is that which separates
the legislative, the executive
and the judicial powers.""
Now, the framers were not just concerned
about the concentration
and exercise of power.
They also understood
the perils of influence.
Judges cannot determine
the constitutionality of laws
if they participate in making those laws,
nor can they hold the other branches
of government accountable
if they collaborate with them
or enter into close
relationships with them.
The Constitution is,
as one famous scholar put it,
""an invitation to struggle.""
And we the people are served
when those branches do, indeed,
struggle with each other.




 4:22


Now, we recognize
the importance of struggle
not just in the public sector
between our branches of government.
We also know it too in the private sector,
in relationships among corporations.
Let's imagine that two American airlines
get together and agree
that they will not drop the price
of their economy class airfares
below 250 dollars a ticket.
That is collaboration,
some would say collusion,
not competition,
and we the people are harmed
because we pay more for our tickets.
Imagine similarly
two airlines were to say,
""Look, Airline A, we'll take
the route from LA to Chicago,""
and Airline B says, ""We'll take
the route from Chicago to DC,
and we won't compete.""
Once again, that's collaboration
or collusion instead of competition,
and we the people are harmed.




 5:22


So we understand
the importance of struggle
when it comes to relationships
between branches of government,
the public sector.
We also understand
the importance of conflict
when it comes to relationships
among corporations,
the private sector.
But where we have forgotten it
is in the relationships
between the public and the private.
And governments all over the world
are collaborating with industry
to solve problems of public health
and the environment,
often collaborating
with the very corporations
that are creating or exacerbating
the problems they are trying to solve.
We are told that these relationships
are a win-win.
But what if someone is losing out?




 6:21


Let me give you some examples.
A United Nations agency
decided to address a serious problem:
poor sanitation in schools in rural India.
They did so not just in collaboration
with national and local governments
but also with a television company
and with a major
multinational soda company.
In exchange for less
than one million dollars,
that corporation received the benefits
of a months-long promotional campaign
including a 12-hour telethon
all using the company's logo
and color scheme.
This was an arrangement
which was totally understandable
from the corporation's point of view.
It enhances the reputation of the company
and it creates brand loyalty
for its products.
But in my view,
this is profoundly problematic
for the intergovernmental agency,
an agency that has a mission
to promote sustainable living.
By increasing consumption
of sugar-sweetened beverages
made from scarce local water supplies
and drunk out of plastic bottles
in a country that is already
grappling with obesity,
this is neither sustainable
from a public health
nor an environmental point of view.
And in order to solve
one public health problem,
the agency is sowing the seeds
of another.




 7:48


This is just one example
of dozens I discovered
in researching a book on the relationships
between government and industry.
I could also have told you
about the initiatives in parks
in London and throughout Britain,
involving the same company,
promoting exercise,
or indeed of the British government
creating voluntary pledges
in partnership with industry
instead of regulating industry.
These collaborations or partnerships
have become the paradigm in public health,
and once again, they make sense
from the point of view of industry.
It allows them to frame
public health problems and their solutions
in ways that are least threatening to,
most consonant with
their commercial interests.
So obesity becomes a problem
of individual decision-making,
of personal behavior,
personal responsibility
and lack of physical activity.
It is not a problem,
when framed this way,
of a multinational food system
involving major corporations.




 8:54


And again, I don't blame industry.
Industry naturally engages
in strategies of influence
to promote its commercial interests.
But governments have a responsibility
to develop counterstrategies
to protect us
and the common good.




 9:13


The mistake that governments are making
when they collaborate in this way
with industry
is that they conflate
the common good
with common ground.
When you collaborate with industry,
you necessarily put off the table
things that might promote the common good
to which industry will not agree.
Industry will not agree
to increased regulation
unless it believes this will
stave off even more regulation
or perhaps knock some competitors
out of the market.
Nor can companies agree
to do certain things,
for example raise the prices
of their unhealthy products,
because that would violate
competition law,
as we've established.
So our governments should not confound
the common good and common ground,
especially when common ground
means reaching agreement with industry.




10:11


I want to give you another example,
moving from high-profile collaboration
to something that is below ground
both literally and figuratively:
the hydraulic fracturing of natural gas.
Imagine that you purchase a plot of land
not knowing the mineral rights
have been sold.
This is before the fracking boom.
You build your dream home on that plot,
and shortly afterwards,
you discover that a gas company
is building a well pad on your land.
That was the plight
of the Hallowich family.
Within a very short period of time,
they began to complain of headaches,
of sore throats, of itchy eyes,
in addition to the interference
of the noise, vibration
and the bright lights
from the flaring of natural gas.
They were very vocal in their criticisms,
and then they fell silent.
And thanks to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette,
where this image appeared,
and one other newspaper,
we discovered why they fell silent.
The newspapers went to the court and said,
""What happened to the Hallowiches?""
And it turned out the Hallowiches
had made a secret settlement
with the gas operators, and it was
a take-it-or-leave-it settlement.
The gas company said,
you can have a six-figure sum
to move elsewhere
and start your lives again,
but in return
you must promise not to speak
of your experience with our company,
not to speak of your
experience with fracking,
not to speak about the health consequences
that might have been revealed
by a medical examination.
Now, I do not blame
the Hallowiches for accepting
a take-it-or-leave-it settlement
and starting their lives elsewhere.
And one can understand
why the company would wish
to silence a squeaky wheel.
What I want to point the finger at
is the legal and regulatory system,
a system in which there are
networks of agreements
just like this one
which serve to silence people
and seal off data points
from public health experts
and epidemiologists,
a system in which regulators
will even refrain
from issuing a violation notice
in the event of pollution
if the landowner and the gas company
agree to settle.
This is a system which isn't just
bad from a public health point of view;
it exposes hazards to local families
who remain in the dark.




12:38


Now, I have given you two examples
not because they are isolated examples.
They are examples of a systemic problem.
I could share some counterexamples,
the case for example
of the public official
who sues the pharmaceutical company
for concealing the fact
that its antidepressant increases
suicidal thoughts in adolescents.
I can tell you about the regulator
who went after the food company
for exaggerating the purported
health benefits of its yogurt.
And I can tell you about the legislator
who despite heavy lobbying
directed at both sides of the aisle
pushes for environmental protections.
These are isolated examples,
but they are beacons of light
in the darkness,
and they can show us the way.




13:33


I began by suggesting that sometimes
we need to engage in conflict.
Governments should tussle with,
struggle with, at times engage
in direct conflict with corporations.
This is not because governments
are inherently good
and corporations are inherently evil.
Each is capable of good or ill.
But corporations understandably
act to promote their commercial interests,
and they do so either sometimes
undermining or promoting the common good.
But it is the responsibility
of governments
to protect and promote the common good.
And we should insist
that they fight to do so.
This is because governments
are the guardians
of public health;
governments are the guardians
of the environment;
and it is governments
that are guardians
of these essential parts
of our common good.




14:46


Thank you.

Two months ago, my kids and I
huddled around a cell phone
watching the live stream
of the Game Awards,
one of the video game
industry's biggest nights.
They announced the nominees
for the Game for Impact,
an award that's given
to a thought-provoking video game
with a profound prosocial
message or meaning.
They opened the envelope
and they read the title of our video game.
An award ...
for impact.
It was almost funny, actually,
because I always thought
that winning an award like that
would have this huge impact on my life,
but I found that the opposite is true.




 0:50


The big nights,
the accomplishments 
they fade.
But the hardest nights of my life
have stuck with me,
impacting who I am
and what I do.




 1:04


In 2010, my third son, Joel, was diagnosed
with a rare and aggressive brain tumor.
And before that year was finished,
doctors sat my husband and I down
and let us know
that his tumor had returned
despite the most aggressive chemotherapy
and radiation that they could offer him.
On that terrible night,
after learning that Joel
had perhaps four months to live,
I cuddled up with
my two older sons in bed 
they were five and three at the time 
and I never really knew
how much they understood,
so I started telling them a bedtime story.
I told them about this
very brave knight named Joel
and his adventure fighting
a terrible dragon called cancer.
Every night, I told them
more of the story,
but I never let the story end.
I was just building up a context
that they could understand
and hoping that our prayers
would be answered
and I would never
have to tell them that that knight,
who had fought so bravely,
was done fighting
and could rest now, forever.




 2:13


Fortunately, I never did have to
finish that bedtime story.
My children outgrew it.
Joel responded better than anyone expected
to palliative treatment,
and so instead of months,
we spent years learning how to love
our dying child with all of our hearts.
Learning to recognize
that shameful feeling
of holding back just a little love
to try to spare ourselves
just a little pain
somewhere further down the road.
We pushed past that self-preservation
because Joel was worth loving
even if that love could crush us.
And that lesson of intense
vulnerability has changed me ...
more than any award ever could.




 3:01


We started living like Joel could live,
and we began developing a video game
called ""That Dragon, Cancer.""
It was the story of Joel.
It was the story of hope
in the shadow of death.
It was the story of faith
and doubt,
and the realization that a wrestle
with doubt is a part of faith 
maybe the biggest part of it.
It was a story that began as a miracle
and ended as a memorial.

 4:09


(Music)




 4:14


When you play ""That Dragon, Cancer,""
you're transformed
into a witness of Joel's life,
exploring an emotional landscape,
clicking to discover more of what
we as a family felt and experienced.
It feels a little bit
like analyzing interactive poetry
because every game mechanic is a metaphor,
and so the more the player asks themselves
what we as designers
were trying to express and why,
the richer the experience becomes.




 4:44


We took that vulnerability
that Joel taught us,
and we encoded the game with it.
Players expect their video games
to offer them branching narrative
so that every decision
that they make feels important
and can change the outcome of the game.
We subverted that principle
of game design,
collapsing the choices in on the player
so that they discover for themselves
that there is nothing that they can do
that will change the outcome for Joel.
And they feel that discovery
as deeply and desperately as we felt it
on nights when we held Joel
in our arms praying for hours,
stubbornly holding out hope for a grace
that we could not create for ourselves.




 5:29


We'd all prefer to win,
but when you discover that you can't win,
what do you value instead?




 5:38


I never planned to write video games,
but these moments
that really change our lives,
they often come as the result
of our hardship  and not our glory.
When we thought that Joel could live,
I left the game designing to my husband.
I chimed in here and there
with a scene or two and some suggestions.
But after the night that Joel died,
the passion,
the possibility of sharing Joel's life
through our video game 
it was something that I couldn't resist.
I started writing more,
I sat in on our team's design meetings,
I added more ideas
and I helped direct scenes.
And I discovered that creating
a video game is telling a story,
but with an entirely new vocabulary.
All the same elements of imagination
and symbolism are there,
but they're just partnered
with player agency
and system responsiveness.
It's challenging work.
I have to think
in a totally new way to do it,
but I love it.
And I wouldn't have known
that without Joel.




 6:45


Maybe you're a little surprised
by our choice to share our story
of terminal cancer through a video game.
Perhaps you're even thinking
like so many people before you:
cancer is not a game.
Well, tell that
to any pediatric cancer parent
that's ever taken an exam glove
and blown it up into a balloon,
or transformed a syringe
into a rocket ship,
or let their child ride their IV pole
through the hospital halls
like it was a race car.
Because when you have children,
everything is a game.
And when your young child
experiences something traumatic,
you work even harder to make sure
that their life feels like a game
because children naturally
explore their worlds through play.
While cancer can steal
many things from a family,
it shouldn't steal play.




 7:38


If you're listening to me
and you're trying to imagine this family
that revolves entirely
around a dying child,
and you can't imagine joy
as part of that picture,
then we were right
to share our story with you,
because that season of our life was hard.
Unspeakably hard at times,
but it was also pure hope,
deep love
and joy like I have never
experienced since.
Our video game was our attempt
to share that world
with people who hadn't
experienced it before,
because we never could imagine
that world until it became ours.




 8:20


We made a video game that's hard to play.
It will never be a blockbuster.
People have to prepare themselves
to invest emotionally
in a story that they know
will break their hearts.
But when our hearts break,
they heal a little differently.
My broken heart has been healing
with a new and a deeper compassion 
a desire to sit with people in their pain,
to hear their stories
and try to help tell them
so that they know that they're seen.




 8:55


On the night when ""That Dragon, Cancer""
won the Game for Impact Award,
we cheered,
we smiled and we talked about Joel
and the impact he had on our life 
on all of those hard and hopeful nights
that we shared with him
when he changed our hearts
and taught us so much more
about life and love and faith and purpose.
That award will never mean as much to me
as even a single photograph of my son,
but it does represent all of the people
who his life has impacted,
people I'll never meet.
They write me emails sometimes.
They tell me that they miss Joel,
even though they never met him.
They describe the tears
that they've shed for my son,
and it makes my burden of grief
just a little bit lighter
knowing that it's shared
with a 10-year-old
watching a YouTube playthrough,
or a doctor playing on his airplane
with a smartphone,
or a professor introducing Joel
to her first-year philosophy students.




10:05


We made a video game that's hard to play.
But that feels just right to me,
because the hardest moments of our lives
change us more than any goal
we could ever accomplish.
Tragedy has shifted my heart
more than any dream
I could ever see come true.




10:27


Thank you.

2734,Siamak Hariri,How do you build a sacred space?,http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/2734,"To design the BahÃ¡'Ã­ Temple of South America, architect Siamak Hariri focused on illumination -- from the temple's form, which captures the movement of the sun throughout the day, to the iridescent, luminous stone and glass used to construct it. Join Hariri for a journey through the creative process, as he explores what makes for a sacred experience in a secular world.",http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/2730/transcript?language=en,3,2017,TEDNYC,0:12:46,4/17/17,796836,"architecture,art,materials,public spaces,collaboration,community,faith,religion,technology,design,engineering,innovation,society","0:11


The school of architecture
that I studied at some 30 years ago
happened to be across the street
from the wonderful art gallery
designed by the great
architect Louis Kahn.
I love the building,
and I used to visit it quite often.
One day,
I saw the security guard run his hand
across the concrete wall.
And it was the way he did it,
the expression on his face 
something touched me.
I could see that the security guard
was moved by the building
and that architecture has that capacity
to move you.
I could see it, and I remember thinking,
""Wow. How does architecture do that?""




 1:02


At school, I was learning to design,
but here  here was
a reaction of the heart.
And it touched me to the core.




 1:16


You know, you aspire for beauty,
for sensuousness, for atmosphere,
the emotional response.
That's the realm of the ineffable
and the immeasurable.
And that's what you live for:
a chance to try.




 1:38


So in 2003, there was
an open call for designs
for the Bah' Temple for South America.
This was the first temple
in all of South America.
It's a continental temple,
a hugely important milestone
for the Bah' community,
because this would be the last
of the continental temples
and would open the door
for national and local temples to be built
around the world.




 2:01


And the brief was deceptively simple
and unique in the annals of religion:
a circular room, nine sides,
nine entrances, nine paths,
allowing you to come to the temple
from all directions,
nine symbolizing completeness,
perfection.
No pulpit, no sermons,
as there are no clergy
in the Bah' faith.
And in a world which is putting up walls,
the design needed to express in form
the very opposite.
It had to be open, welcoming
to people of all faiths,
walks of life, backgrounds,
or no faith at all;
a new form of sacred space
with no pattern
or models to draw from.
It was like designing one of the first
churches for Christianity
or one of the first mosques for Islam.




 3:13


So we live in a secular world.
How do you design sacred space today?
And how do you even define
what's sacred today?




 3:32


I stumbled across this beautiful quote
from the Bah' writings,
and it speaks to prayer.
It says that if you reach out in prayer,
and if your prayer is answered 
which is already very interesting 
that the pillars of your heart
will become ashine.




 3:53


And I loved this idea
of the inner and the outer,
like when you see someone
and you say, ""That person is radiant.""
And I was thinking, ""My gosh,
how could we make something
architectural out of that,
where you create a building
and it becomes alive with light?
Like alabaster, if you kiss it with light,
it becomes alive.
And I drew this sketch,
something with two layers, translucent
with structure in between capturing light.
Maybe a pure form,
a single form of emanation
that you could imagine
would be all dome
and everything we kept making
was looking too much like an egg.




 4:47


(Laughter)




 4:48


A blob.




 4:50


So you search.
You all know this crazy search,
letting the process take you,
and you live for the surprises.
And I remember quite by accident
I saw this little video
of a plant moving in light,
and it made me think of movement,
reach,
this idea that the temple
could have reach,
like this reach for the divine.
You can imagine also
that movement within a circle
could mean movement and stillness,
like the cosmos,
something you see in many places.




 5:28


(Laughter)




 5:31


But rotation was not enough,
because we needed a form.
In the Bah' writings, it talks about
the temples being as perfect
as is humanly possible,
and we kept thinking,
well, what is perfection?
And I remember I stumbled into this image
of this Japanese basket
and thinking our Western notions
of perfection need to be challenged,
that this wonderful silhouette
of this basket, this wonkiness,
and that it has the kind of dimple
of what you might imagine a shoulder
or the cheekbone,
and that kind of organic form.
And so we drew and made models,
these lines that merge at the top,
soft lines,
which became like drapery
and translucent veils and folding,
and the idea of not only
folding but torquing 
you remember the plant
and the way it was reaching.
And this started to become
an interesting form,
carving the base, making the entrances.




 6:40


And then we ended up with this.
This is this temple with two layers,
nine luminous veils,
embodied light,
soft-flowing lines
like luminescent drapery.
180 submissions
were received from 80 countries,
and this was selected.




 7:01


So we went to the next stage
of how to build it.
We had submitted alabaster.
But alabaster was too soft,
and we were experimenting,
many experiments with materials,
trying to think how we could have
this kind of shimmer,
and we ended up with borosilicate.
And borosilicate glass,
as you know, is very strong,
and if you break borosilicate rods
just so and melt them
at just the right temperature,
we ended up with this new material,
this new cast glass which took us
about two years to make.
And it had this quality that we loved,
this idea of the embodied light,
but on the inside, we wanted
something with a soft light,
like the inner lining of a jacket.
On the outside you have protection,
but on the inside you touch it.
So we found this tiny vein
in a huge quarry in Portugal
with this beautiful stone,
which the owner had kept
for seven generations in his family,
waiting for the right project,
if you can believe it.
Look at this material, it's beautiful.
And the way it lights up;
it has that translucent quality.




 8:25


So here you see the structure.
It lets the light through.
And looking down,
the nine wings are bound,
structurally but symbolically strong,
a great symbol of unity:
pure geometry, a perfect circle,
30 meters in section and in plan,
perfectly symmetrical,
like the idea of sacredness and geometry.
And here you see the building going up,
2,000 steel nodes,
9,000 pieces of steel,
7,800 stone pieces,
10,000 cast glass pieces,
all individual shapes,
the entire superstructure all described,
engineered, fabricated
with aerospace technology,
prefabricated machine to machine,
robotically,
a huge team effort, you can imagine,
of literally hundreds,
and within three percent
of our $30 million budget
set in 2006.




 9:37


(Applause)




 9:41


Nine wings bound together
forming a nine-pointed star,
and the star shape moving in space,
tracking the sun.




10:06


So here it is.




10:08


Audience: Wow!




10:10


(Applause)




10:18


Hopefully, a befitting response
to that beautiful quote,
""a prayer answered,""
open in all directions,
capturing the blue light of dawn,
tent-like white light of day,
the gold light of the afternoon,
and of course, at night, the reversal:
sensuous,
catching the light in all kinds
of mysterious ways.




10:52


And the site: it's interesting;
14 years ago when we made the submission,
we showed the temple
set against the Andes.
We didn't have the Andes as our site,
but after nine years, that's exactly
where we ended up,
the lines of the temple set against
nothing but pure nature,
and you turn around and you get
nothing but the city below you,
and inside, a view in all directions,
radiating gardens
from each of the alcoves,
radiating paths.




11:35


Last October, the opening ceremonies 
a beautiful, sacred event,
5,000 people from 80 countries,
a continuous river of visitors,
indigenous people
from all over South America,
some who had never left their villages.
And of course, that this temple
belongs to people,
the collective, of many cultures
and walks of life,
many beliefs,
and for me, what's most important
is what it feels like on the inside;
that it feel intimate,
sacred,
and that everyone is welcome.
And if even a few who come
have the same reaction
as that security guard,
then it truly would be their temple.
And I would love that.




12:37


Thank you.

Around the world, the crime became epitomized by the slogan #BringBackOurGirls -- but in Nigeria, government officials called the crime a hoax, confusing and delaying efforts to rescue the girls. In this powerful talk, journalist Stephanie Busari points to the Chibok tragedy to explain the deadly danger of fake news and what we can do to stop it.",http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/2736/transcript?language=en,2,2017,TEDLagos Ideas Search,0:06:26,4/24/17,715340,"Africa,terrorism,trafficking,community,global issues,communication,writing,journalism,social change,humanity,society","0:12


I want to tell you a story about a girl.
But I can't tell you her real name.
So let's just call her Hadiza.




 0:20


Hadiza is 20.
She's shy,
but she has a beautiful smile
that lights up her face.
But she's in constant pain.
And she will likely be on medication
for the rest of her life.




 0:36


Do you want to know why?
Hadiza is a Chibok girl,
and on April 14, 2014, she was kidnapped
by Boko Haram terrorists.
She managed to escape, though,
by jumping off the truck
that was carrying the girls.
But when she landed,
she broke both her legs,
and she had to crawl on her tummy
to hide in the bushes.
She told me she was terrified
that Boko Haram would come back for her.
She was one of 57 girls who would escape
by jumping off trucks that day.




 1:09


This story, quite rightly, caused ripples
around the world.
People like Michelle Obama,
Malala and others
lent their voices in protest,
and at about the same time 
I was living in London at the time 
I was sent from London to Abuja
to cover the World Economic Forum
that Nigeria was hosting
for the first time.
But when we arrived, it was clear
that there was only one story in town.
We put the government under pressure.
We asked tough questions
about what they were doing
to bring these girls back.
Understandably,
they weren't too happy
with our line of questioning,
and let's just say we received
our fair share of ""alternative facts.""




 1:49


(Laughter)




 1:52


Influential Nigerians
were telling us at the time
that we were nave,
we didn't understand
the political situation in Nigeria.
But they also told us
that the story of the Chibok girls
was a hoax.
Sadly, this hoax narrative has persisted,
and there are still people
in Nigeria today
who believe that the Chibok girls
were never kidnapped.
Yet I was talking to people like these 
devastated parents,
who told us that on the day
Boko Haram kidnapped their daughters,
they ran into the Sambisa Forest
after the trucks carrying their daughters.
They were armed with machetes,
but they were forced to turn back
because Boko Haram had guns.




 2:38


For two years, inevitably,
the news agenda moved on,
and for two years,
we didn't hear much
about the Chibok girls.
Everyone presumed they were dead.
But in April last year,
I was able to obtain this video.
This is a still from the video
that Boko Haram filmed as a proof of life,
and through a source,
I obtained this video.
But before I could publish it,
I had to travel
to the northeast of Nigeria
to talk to the parents, to verify it.
I didn't have to wait
too long for confirmation.
One of the mothers,
when she watched the video, told me
that if she could have reached
into the laptop
and pulled our her child from the laptop,
she would have done so.
For those of you who are parents,
like myself, in the audience,
you can only imagine the anguish
that that mother felt.




 3:36


This video would go on to kick-start
negotiation talks with Boko Haram.
And a Nigerian senator told me
that because of this video
they entered into those talks,
because they had long presumed
that the Chibok girls were dead.
Twenty-one girls were freed
in October last year.
Sadly, nearly 200 of them
still remain missing.




 4:02


I must confess that I have not been
a dispassionate observer
covering this story.
I am furious when I think
about the wasted opportunities
to rescue these girls.
I am furious when I think about
what the parents have told me,
that if these were daughters
of the rich and the powerful,
they would have been found much earlier.
And I am furious
that the hoax narrative,
I firmly believe,
caused a delay;
it was part of the reason
for the delay in their return.




 4:37


This illustrates to me
the deadly danger of fake news.
So what can we do about it?
There are some very smart people,
smart engineers at Google and Facebook,
who are trying to use technology
to stop the spread of fake news.
But beyond that, I think
everybody here  you and I 
we have a role to play in that.
We are the ones who share the content.
We are the ones who share
the stories online.
In this day and age, we're all publishers,
and we have responsibility.




 5:12


In my job as a journalist,
I check, I verify.
I trust my gut, but I ask tough questions.
Why is this person telling me this story?
What do they have to gain
by sharing this information?
Do they have a hidden agenda?
I really believe that we must all start
to ask tougher questions
of information that we discover online.




 5:40


Research shows that some of us
don't even read beyond headlines
before we share stories.
Who here has done that?
I know I have.
But what if
we stopped taking information
that we discover at face value?
What if we stop to think
about the consequence
of the information that we pass on
and its potential to incite
violence or hatred?
What if we stop to think
about the real-life consequences
of the information that we share?




 6:19


Thank you very much for listening.

Last year ...
was hell.




 0:15


(Laughter)




 0:19


It was my first time eating
Nigerian ""jollof.""




 0:23


(Laughter)




 0:25


Actually, in all seriousness,
I was going through a lot
of personal turmoil.
Faced with enormous stress,
I suffered an anxiety attack.
On some days, I could do no work.
On other days,
I just wanted to lay in my bed and cry.




 0:47


My doctor asked if I'd like to speak
with a mental health professional
about my stress and anxiety.
Mental health?
I clammed up and violently
shook my head in protest.
I felt a profound sense of a shame.
I felt the weight of stigma.
I have a loving, supportive family
and incredibly loyal friends,
yet I could not entertain
the idea of speaking to anyone
about my feeling of pain.
I felt suffocated
by the rigid architecture
of our African masculinity.
""People have real problems, Sangu.
Get over yourself!""




 1:39


The first time I heard ""mental health,""
I was a boarding school student
fresh off the boat from Ghana,
at the Peddie School in New Jersey.
I had just gone through
the brutal experience
of losing seven loved ones
in the same month.
The school nurse,
concerned about what I'd gone
through  God bless her soul 
she inquired about my mental health.
""Is she mental?"" I thought.
Does she not know I'm an African man?




 2:11


(Laughter)




 2:12


Like Okonkwo in ""Things Fall Apart,""
we African men neither process
nor express our emotions.
We deal with our problems.




 2:21


(Applause)




 2:24


We deal with our problems.
I called my brother and laughed
about ""Oyibo"" people  white people 
and their strange diseases 
depression, ADD and those ""weird things.""
Growing up in West Africa,
when people used the term ""mental,""
what came to mind was a madman
with dirty, dread-locked hair,
bumbling around half-naked on the streets.
We all know this man.
Our parents warned us about him.
""Mommy, mommy, why is he mad?""
""Drugs!
If you even look at drugs,
you end up like him.""




 3:00


(Laughter)




 3:01


Come down with pneumonia,
and your mother will rush you
to the nearest hospital
for medical treatment.
But dare to declare depression,
and your local pastor
will be driving out demons
and blaming witches in your village.




 3:18


According to the World
Health Organization,
mental health is about being able to cope
with the normal stressors of life;
to work productively and fruitfully;
and to be able to make
a contribution to your community.
Mental health includes our emotional,
psychological and social well-being.
Globally, 75 percent
of all mental illness cases
can be found in low-income countries.
Yet most African governments
invest less than one percent
of their health care budget
in mental health.




 3:57


Even worse,
we have a severe shortage
of psychiatrists in Africa.
Nigeria, for example,
is estimated to have 200 
in a country of almost 200 million.
In all of Africa,
90 percent of our people
lack access to treatment.
As a result,
we suffer in solitude,
silenced by stigma.




 4:28


We as Africans often respond
to mental health with distance,
ignorance,
guilt,
fear
and anger.
In a study conducted by Arboleda-Flrez,
directly asking, ""What is the cause
of mental illness?""
34 percent of Nigerian respondents
cited drug misuse;
19 percent said divine wrath
and the will of God 




 5:02


(Laughter)




 5:04


12 percent,
witchcraft and spiritual possession.
But few cited other known
causes of mental illness,
like genetics,
socioeconomic status,
war,
conflict
or the loss of a loved one.
The stigmatization against mental illness
often results in the ostracizing
and demonizing of sufferers.
Photojournalist Robin Hammond
has documented some of these abuses ...
in Uganda,
in Somalia,
and here in Nigeria.




 5:46


For me,
the stigma is personal.
In 2009,
I received a frantic call
in the middle of the night.
My best friend in the world 
a brilliant, philosophical,
charming, hip young man 
was diagnosed with schizophrenia.
I witnessed some of the friends
we'd grown up with recoil.
I heard the snickers.
I heard the whispers.
""Did you hear he has gone mad?""
(Kru English) ""He has gone crazy!""
Derogatory, demeaning commentary
about his condition 
words we would never say
about someone with cancer
or someone with malaria.
Somehow, when it comes to mental illness,
our ignorance eviscerates all empathy.
I stood by his side
as his community isolated him,
but our love never wavered.




 6:56


Tacitly, I became passionate
about mental health.
Inspired by his plight,
I helped found the mental health
special interest alumni group
at my college.
And during my tenure as a resident
tutor in graduate school,
I supported many undergraduates
with their mental health challenges.
I saw African students struggle
and unable to speak to anyone.
Even with this knowledge
and with their stories in tow,
I, in turn, struggled,
and could not speak to anyone
when I faced my own anxiety,
so deep is our fear of being the madman.




 7:38


All of us 
but we Africans especially 
need to realize that our mental struggles
do not detract from our virility,
nor does our trauma taint our strength.
We need to see mental health
as important as physical health.
We need to stop suffering in silence.
We must stop stigmatizing disease
and traumatizing the afflicted.




 8:12


Talk to your friends.
Talk to your loved ones.
Talk to health professionals.
Be vulnerable.
Do so with the confidence
that you are not alone.
Speak up if you're struggling.
Being honest about how we feel
does not make us weak;
it makes us human.




 8:42


It is time to end the stigma
associated with mental illness.
So the next time your hear ""mental,""
do not just think of the madman.
Think of me.




 8:56


(Applause)




 8:58


Thank you.

2743,Michael Bierut,How to design a library that makes kids want to read,http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/2743,"When Michael Bierut was tapped to design a logo for public school libraries, he had no idea that he was embarking on a years-long passion project. In this often hilarious talk, he recalls his obsessive quest to bring energy, learning, art and graphics into these magical spaces where school librarians can inspire new generations of readers and thinkers.",http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/2743/transcript?language=en,3,2017,TEDNYC,0:12:26,6/2/17,596339,"design,education,library","0:11


So there's this thing called
the law of unintended consequences.
I thought it was just like a saying,
but it actually exists, I guess.
There's, like, academic papers about it.
And I'm a designer.
I don't like unintended consequences.
People hire me because they have
consequences that they really intend,
and what they intend is for me
to help them achieve those consequences.
So I live in fear
of unintended consequences.
And so this is a story about
consequences intended and unintended.




 0:43


I got called by an organization
called Robin Hood
to do a favor for them.
Robin Hood is based in New York,
a wonderful philanthropic organization
that does what it says in the name.
They take from rich people,
give it to poor people.
In this case, what they wanted to benefit
was the New York City school system,
a huge enterprise that educates
more than a million students at a time,
and in buildings that are like this one,
old buildings, big buildings,
drafty buildings, sometimes buildings
that are in disrepair,
certainly buildings
that could use a renovation.
Robin Hood had this ambition
to improve these buildings in some way,
but what they realized was
to fix the buildings would be
too expensive and impractical.
So instead they tried to figure out
what one room they could go into
in each of these buildings,
in as many buildings that they could,
and fix that one room
so that they could improve
the lives of the children inside
as they were studying.
And what they came up with
was the school library,
and they came up with this idea
called the Library Initiative.
All the students
have to pass through the library.
That's where the books are.
That's where the heart
and soul of the school is.
So let's fix these libraries.




 1:52


So they did this wonderful thing
where they brought in
first 10, then 20, then more architects,
each one of whom was assigned a library
to rethink what a library was.
They trained special librarians.
So they started this mighty enterprise
to reform public schools
by improving these libraries.
Then they called me up and they said,
""Could you make a little contribution?""
I said, ""Sure, what do you want me to do?""
And they said, ""Well, we want you
to be the graphic designer
in charge of the whole thing.""
And so I thought, I know what that means.
That means I get to design a logo.
I know how to design that. I design logos.
That's what people come to me for.
So OK, let's design a logo for this thing.
Easy to do, actually,
compared with architecture
and being a librarian.
Just do a logo, make a contribution,
and then you're out,
and you feel really good about yourself.
And I'm a great guy and I like to feel
good about myself when I do these favors.




 2:40


So I thought, let's overdeliver.
I'm going to give you three logos,
all based on this one idea.
So you have three options,
pick any of the three.
They're all great, I said.
So the basic idea was
these would be new school libraries
for New York schools,
and so the idea is that it's a new thing,
a new idea that needs a new name.
What I wanted to do was dispel the idea
that these were musty old libraries,
the kind of places
that everyone is bored with,
you know, not your grandparents' library.
Don't worry about that at all.
This is going to this new, exciting thing,
not a boring library.




 3:13


So option number one:
so instead of thinking of it as a library,
think of it as a place where it is like:
do talk, do make loud noises.
Right? So no shushing,
it's like a shush-free zone.
We're going to call it the Reading Room.




 3:27


That was option number one.
OK, option number two.
Option number two was, wait for it,
OWL.
I'll meet you at OWL.
I'm getting my book from the OWL.
Meet you after school down at OWL.
I like that, right?
Now, what does OWL stand for?
Well, it could be One World Library,
or it could be Open. Wonder. Learn.
Or it could be  and I figure librarians
could figure out other things it could be
because they know about words.
So other things, right?
And then look at this.
It's like the eye of the owl.
This is irresistible in my opinion.




 3:58


But there's even another idea.
Option number three.
Option number three
was based actually on language.
It's the idea that ""read""
is the past tense of ""read,""
and they're both spelled the same way.
So why don't we call
this place The Red Zone?
I'll meet you at the Red Zone.
Are you Red? Get Red.
I'm well Red.




 4:18


(Laughter)




 4:19


I really loved this idea,
and I somehow was not focused on the idea
that librarians as a class are sort of
interested in spelling and I don't know.




 4:29


(Laughter)




 4:30


But sometimes cleverness
is more important than spelling,
and I thought this would be
one of those instances.
So usually when I make these presentations
I say there's just one question
and the question should be,
""How can I thank you, Mike?""
But in this case,
the question was more like,
""Um, are you kidding?""
Because, they said,
the premise of all this work
was that kids were bored
with old libraries, musty old libraries.
They were tired of them.
And instead, they said, these kids
have never really seen a library.
The school libraries in these schools
are really so dilapidated,
if they're there at all,
that they haven't bored anyone.
They haven't even been there
to bore anyone at all.
So the idea was, just forget
about giving it a new name.
Just call it, one last try, a library.
Right? OK.
So I thought, OK, give it a little oomph?
Exclamation point?
Then  this is because I'm clever 
move that into the ""i,""
make it red,
and there you have it,
the Library Initiative.
So I thought, mission accomplished,
there's your logo.
So what's interesting about this logo,
an unintended consequence,
was that it turned out that
they didn't really even need my design
because you could type it any font,
you could write it by hand,
and when they started
sending emails around,
they just would use Shift and 1,
they'd get their own logo
just right out of the thing.
And I thought, well, that's fine.
Feel free to use that logo.
And then I embarked
on the real rollout of this thing 
working with every one of the architects
to put this logo on the front door
of their own library. Right?




 6:01


So here's the big rollout.
Basically I'd work
with different architects.
First Robin Hood was my client.
Now these architects were my client.
I'd say, ""Here's your logo.
Put it on the door.""
""Here's your logo. Put it on both doors.""
""Here's your logo.
Put it off to the side.""
""Here's your logo
repeated all over to the top.""
So everything was going swimmingly.
I just was saying,
""Here's your logo. Here's your logo.""




 6:21


Then I got a call
from one of the architects,
a guy named Richard Lewis,
and he says, ""I've got a problem.
You're the graphics guy.
Can you solve it?""
And I said, OK, sure.""
And he said, ""The problem is
that there's a space
between the shelf and the ceiling.""
So that sounds like
an architectural issue to me,
not a graphic design issue,
so I'm, ""Go on.""
And Richard says, ""Well,
the top shelf has to be low enough
for the kid to reach it,
but I'm in a big old building,
and the ceilings are really high,
so actually I've got
all this space up there
and I need something like a mural.""
And I'm like, ""Whoa,
you know, I'm a logo designer.
I'm not Diego Rivera or something.
I'm not a muralist.""
And so he said, ""But can't you
think of anything?""
So I said, ""OK, what if we just
took pictures of the kids in the school
and just put them around
the top of the thing,
and maybe that could work.""
And my wife is a photographer,
and I said, ""Dorothy, there's no budget,
can you come to this school
in east New York, take these pictures?""
And she did,
and if you go in Richard's library,
which is one of the first that opened,
it has this glorious frieze
of, like, the heroes of the school,
oversized, looking down
into the little dollhouse
of the real library, right?
And the kids were great,
hand-selected by the principals
and the librarian.
It just kind of created
this heroic atmosphere in this library,
this very dignified setting below
and the joy of the children above.




 7:40


So naturally all the other librarians
in the other schools see this
and they said, well, we want murals too.
And I'm like, OK.
So then I think, well,
it can't be the same mural every time,
so Dorothy did another one,
and then she did another one,
but then we needed more help,
so I called an illustrator I knew
named Lynn Pauley,
and Lynn did these beautiful
paintings of the kids.
Then I called a guy named Charles Wilkin
at a place called Automatic Design.
He did these amazing collages.
We had Rafael Esquer
do these great silhouettes.
He would work with the kids,
asking for words,
and then based on those prompts,
come up with this little,
delirious kind of constellation
of silhouettes
of things that are in books.
Peter Arkle interviewed the kids
and had them talk
about their favorite books
and he put their testimony
as a frieze up there.
Stefan Sagmeister worked with Yuko Shimizu
and they did this amazing
manga-style statement,
""Everyone who is honest is interesting,""
that goes all the way around.
Christoph Niemann, brilliant illustrator,
did a whole series of things
where he embedded books
into the faces and characters
and images and places
that you find in the books.
And then even Maira Kalman
did this amazing cryptic installation
of objects and words
that kind of go all around
and will fascinate students
for as long as it's up there.




 8:56


So this was really satisfying,
and basically my role here was reading
a series of dimensions to these artists,
and I would say,
""Three feet by 15 feet, whatever you want.
Let me know if you have
any problem with that.""
And they would go and install these.
It just was the greatest thing.




 9:13


But the greatest thing, actually, was 
Every once in a while,
I'd get, like, an invitation in the mail
made of construction paper,
and it would say, ""You are invited
to the opening of our new library.""
So you'd go to the library,
say, you'd go to PS10,
and you'd go inside.
There'd be balloons,
there'd be a student ambassador,
there'd be speeches that were read,
poetry that was written
specifically for the opening,
dignitaries would present people
with certificates,
and the whole thing
was just a delirious, fun party.
So I loved going to these things.
I would stand there dressed like this,
obviously not belonging,
and someone would say,
""What are you doing here, mister?""
And I'd say, ""Well, I'm part of the team
that designed this place.""
And they'd said, ""You do these shelves?""
And I said, ""No.""
""You took the pictures up above.""
""No.""
""Well, what did you do?""
""You know when you came in?
The sign over the door?""
""The sign that says library?""




10:02


(Laughter)




10:03


""Yeah, I did that!""
And then they'd sort of go,
""OK. Nice work if you can get it.""
So it was so satisfying
going to these little openings
despite the fact that I was
kind of largely ignored or humiliated,
but it was actually fun
going to the openings,
so I decided that I wanted
to get the people in my office
who had worked on these projects,
get the illustrators and photographers,
and I said, why don't we rent a van
and drive around
the five boroughs of New York
and see how many we could hit at one time.
And eventually there were
going to be 60 of these libraries,
so we probably got to see
maybe half a dozen in one long day.
And the best thing of all
was meeting these librarians
who kind of were running these,
took possession of these places
like their private stage
upon which they were invited
to mesmerize their students
and bring the books to life,
and it was just
this really exciting experience
for all of us to actually
see these things in action.
So we spent a long day doing this
and we were in the very last library.
It was still winter,
because it got dark early,
and the librarian says,
""I'm about to close down.
So really nice having you here.
Hey, wait a second, do you want to see
how I turn off the lights?""
I'm like, ""OK.""
And she said, ""I have
this special way that I do it.""
And then she showed me.
What she did was she turned out
every light one by one by one by one,
and the last light she left on
was the light that illuminated
the kids' faces,
and she said, ""That's the last light
I turn off every night,
because I like to remind myself
why I come to work.""




11:30


So when I started this whole thing,
remember, it was just
about designing that logo
and being clever, come up with a new name?
The unintended consequence here,
which I would like to take credit for
and like to think I can think through
the experience to that extent,
but I can't.
I was just focused on a foot ahead of me,
as far as I could reach with my own hands.
Instead, way off in the distance
was a librarian
who was going to find
the chain of consequences
that we had set in motion,
a source of inspiration
so that she in this case
could do her work really well.
40,000 kids a year
are affected by these libraries.
They've been happening
for more than 10 years now,
so those librarians have kind of turned on
a generation of children to books
and so it's been a thrill to find out
that sometimes unintended consequences
are the best consequences.




12:19


Thank you very much.

[His Holiness Pope Francis
Filmed in Vatican City
First shown at TED2017]




 0:15


Good evening  or, good morning,
I am not sure what time it is there.
Regardless of the hour, I am thrilled
to be participating in your conference.
I very much like its title
 ""The Future You"" 
because, while looking at tomorrow,
it invites us to open a dialogue today,
to look at the future through a ""you.""
""The Future You:""
the future is made of yous,
it is made of encounters,
because life flows
through our relations with others.
Quite a few years of life
have strengthened my conviction
that each and everyone's existence
is deeply tied to that of others:
life is not time merely passing by,
life is about interactions.




 1:27


As I meet, or lend an ear
to those who are sick,
to the migrants
who face terrible hardships
in search of a brighter future,
to prison inmates who carry
a hell of pain inside their hearts,
and to those, many of them young,
who cannot find a job,
I often find myself wondering:
""Why them and not me?""
I, myself, was born
in a family of migrants;
my father, my grandparents,
like many other Italians,
left for Argentina
and met the fate of those
who are left with nothing.
I could have very well ended up
among today's ""discarded"" people.
And that's why I always ask myself,
deep in my heart:
""Why them and not me?""




 2:35


First and foremost, I would love it
if this meeting could help to remind us
that we all need each other,
none of us is an island,
an autonomous and independent ""I,""
separated from the other,
and we can only build the future
by standing together, including everyone.
We dont think about it often,
but everything is connected,
and we need to restore
our connections to a healthy state.
Even the harsh judgment I hold in my heart
against my brother or my sister,
the open wound that was never cured,
the offense that was never forgiven,
the rancor that is only going to hurt me,
are all instances of a fight
that I carry within me,
a flare deep in my heart
that needs to be extinguished
before it goes up in flames,
leaving only ashes behind.




 3:38


Many of us, nowadays,
seem to believe that a happy future
is something impossible to achieve.
While such concerns
must be taken very seriously,
they are not invincible.
They can be overcome when we don't lock
our door to the outside world.
Happiness can only be discovered
as a gift of harmony between the whole
and each single component.
Even science  and you know it
better than I do 
points to an understanding of reality
as a place where every element connects
and interacts with everything else.




 4:27


And this brings me to my second message.
How wonderful would it be
if the growth of scientific
and technological innovation
would come along with more equality
and social inclusion.
How wonderful would it be,
while we discover faraway planets,
to rediscover the needs of the brothers
and sisters orbiting around us.
How wonderful would it be if solidarity,
this beautiful and, at times,
inconvenient word,
were not simply reduced to social work,
and became, instead, the default attitude
in political, economic
and scientific choices,
as well as in the relationships
among individuals, peoples and countries.
Only by educating people
to a true solidarity
will we be able to overcome
the ""culture of waste,""
which doesn't concern only food and goods
but, first and foremost, the people
who are cast aside
by our techno-economic systems
which, without even realizing it,
are now putting products
at their core, instead of people.




 6:08


Solidarity is a term that many wish
to erase from the dictionary.
Solidarity, however,
is not an automatic mechanism.
It cannot be programmed or controlled.
It is a free response born
from the heart of each and everyone.
Yes, a free response!
When one realizes
that life, even in the middle
of so many contradictions, is a gift,
that love is the source
and the meaning of life,
how can they withhold their urge
to do good to another fellow being?




 6:50


In order to do good,
we need memory, we need courage
and we need creativity.
And I know that TED
gathers many creative minds.
Yes, love does require
a creative, concrete
and ingenious attitude.
Good intentions and conventional formulas,
so often used to appease
our conscience, are not enough.
Let us help each other,
all together, to remember
that the other is not
a statistic or a number.
The other has a face.
The ""you"" is always a real presence,
a person to take care of.




 7:52


There is a parable Jesus told
to help us understand the difference
between those who'd rather not be bothered
and those who take care of the other.
I am sure you have heard it before.
It is the Parable of the Good Samaritan.
When Jesus was asked:
""Who is my neighbor?"" -
namely, ""Who should I take care of?"" -
he told this story, the story of a man
who had been assaulted, robbed,
beaten and abandoned along a dirt road.
Upon seeing him, a priest and a Levite,
two very influential people of the time,
walked past him without stopping to help.
After a while, a Samaritan, a very much
despised ethnicity at the time, walked by.
Seeing the injured man
lying on the ground,
he did not ignore him
as if he weren't even there.
Instead, he felt compassion for this man,
which compelled him to act
in a very concrete manner.
He poured oil and wine
on the wounds of the helpless man,
brought him to a hostel
and paid out of his pocket
for him to be assisted.




 9:26


The story of the Good Samaritan
is the story of todays humanity.
People's paths are riddled with suffering,
as everything is centered around money,
and things, instead of people.
And often there is this habit, by people
who call themselves ""respectable,""
of not taking care of the others,
thus leaving behind thousands
of human beings, or entire populations,
on the side of the road.
Fortunately, there are also those
who are creating a new world
by taking care of the other,
even out of their own pockets.
Mother Teresa actually said:
""One cannot love,
unless it is at their own expense.""




10:26


We have so much to do,
and we must do it together.
But how can we do that
with all the evil we breathe every day?
Thank God,
no system can nullify our desire
to open up to the good,
to compassion and to our capacity
to react against evil,
all of which stem
from deep within our hearts.
Now you might tell me,
""Sure, these are beautiful words,
but I am not the Good Samaritan,
nor Mother Teresa of Calcutta.""
On the contrary: we are precious,
each and every one of us.
Each and every one of us
is irreplaceable in the eyes of God.
Through the darkness of today's conflicts,
each and every one of us
can become a bright candle,
a reminder that light
will overcome darkness,
and never the other way around.




11:27


To Christians,
the future does have a name,
and its name is Hope.
Feeling hopeful does not mean
to be optimistically nave
and ignore the tragedy humanity is facing.
Hope is the virtue of a heart
that doesn't lock itself into darkness,
that doesn't dwell on the past,
does not simply get by in the present,
but is able to see a tomorrow.
Hope is the door
that opens onto the future.
Hope is a humble, hidden seed of life
that, with time,
will develop into a large tree.
It is like some invisible yeast
that allows the whole dough to grow,
that brings flavor to all aspects of life.
And it can do so much,
because a tiny flicker of light
that feeds on hope
is enough to shatter
the shield of darkness.
A single individual
is enough for hope to exist,
and that individual can be you.
And then there will be another ""you,""
and another ""you,""
and it turns into an ""us.""
And so, does hope begin
when we have an ""us?""
No.
Hope began with one ""you.""
When there is an ""us,""
there begins a revolution.




13:16


The third message
I would like to share today
is, indeed, about revolution:
the revolution of tenderness.
And what is tenderness?
It is the love that comes close
and becomes real.
It is a movement
that starts from our heart
and reaches the eyes,
the ears and the hands.
Tenderness means to use
our eyes to see the other,
our ears to hear the other,
to listen to the children, the poor,
those who are afraid of the future.
To listen also to the silent cry
of our common home,
of our sick and polluted earth.
Tenderness means to use
our hands and our heart
to comfort the other,
to take care of those in need.




14:13


Tenderness is the language
of the young children,
of those who need the other.
A childs love for mom and dad
grows through their touch, their gaze,
their voice, their tenderness.
I like when I hear parents
talk to their babies,
adapting to the little child,
sharing the same level of communication.
This is tenderness:
being on the same level as the other.
God himself descended into Jesus
to be on our level.
This is the same path
the Good Samaritan took.
This is the path that Jesus himself took.
He lowered himself,
he lived his entire human existence
practicing the real,
concrete language of love.




15:23


Yes, tenderness is the path of choice
for the strongest,
most courageous men and women.
Tenderness is not weakness;
it is fortitude.
It is the path of solidarity,
the path of humility.
Please, allow me to say it loud and clear:
the more powerful you are,
the more your actions
will have an impact on people,
the more responsible you are
to act humbly.
If you dont, your power will ruin you,
and you will ruin the other.
There is a saying in Argentina:
""Power is like drinking gin
on an empty stomach.""
You feel dizzy, you get drunk,
you lose your balance,
and you will end up hurting yourself
and those around you,
if you dont connect your power
with humility and tenderness.
Through humility and concrete love,
on the other hand,
power  the highest, the strongest one 
becomes a service, a force for good.




16:52


The future of humankind isn't exclusively
in the hands of politicians,
of great leaders, of big companies.
Yes, they do hold
an enormous responsibility.
But the future is, most of all,
in the hands of those people
who recognize the other as a ""you""
and themselves as part of an ""us.""
We all need each other.
And so, please, think of me
as well with tenderness,
so that I can fulfill the task
I have been given
for the good of the other,
of each and every one, of all of you,
of all of us.
Thank you.",
2769,Deborah Lipstadt,Behind the lies of Holocaust denial,http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/2769,"""There are facts, there are opinions, and there are lies,"" says historian Deborah Lipstadt, telling the remarkable story of her research into Holocaust deniers -- and their deliberate distortion of history. Lipstadt encourages us all to go on the offensive against those who assault the truth and facts. ""Truth is not relative,"" she says.",http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/2744/transcript?language=en,4,2017,TEDxSkoll,0:15:30,5/2/17,561322,"global issues,history,communication,war,violence,law,writing,TEDx,humanity,society","0:12


I come to you today to speak of liars,
lawsuits
and laughter.
The first time I heard
about Holocaust denial,
I laughed.
Holocaust denial?
The Holocaust which has
the dubious distinction
of being the best-documented
genocide in the world?
Who could believe it didn't happen?




 0:39


Think about it.
For deniers to be right,
who would have to be wrong?
Well, first of all, the victims 
the survivors who have told us
their harrowing stories.
Who else would have to be wrong?
The bystanders.
The people who lived in the myriads
of towns and villages and cities
on the Eastern front,
who watched their neighbors
be rounded up 
men, women, children, young, old 
and be marched
to the outskirts of the town
to be shot and left dead in ditches.
Or the Poles,
who lived in towns and villages
around the death camps,
who watched day after day
as the trains went in filled with people
and came out empty.




 1:30


But above all, who would have to be wrong?
The perpetrators.
The people who say, ""We did it.
I did it.""
Now, maybe they add a caveat.
They say, ""I didn't have a choice;
I was forced to do it.""
But nonetheless, they say, ""I did it.""
Think about it.
In not one war crimes trial
since the end of World War II
has a perpetrator of any nationality
ever said, ""It didn't happen.""
Again, they may have said, ""I was forced,""
but never that it didn't happen.
Having thought that through,
I decided denial was not
going to be on my agenda;
I had bigger things to worry about,
to write about, to research,
and I moved on.




 2:23


Fast-forward a little over a decade,
and two senior scholars 
two of the most prominent historians
of the Holocaust 
approached me and said,
""Deborah, let's have coffee.
We have a research idea
that we think is perfect for you.""
Intrigued and flattered
that they came to me with an idea
and thought me worthy of it,
I asked, ""What is it?""
And they said, ""Holocaust denial.""
And for the second time, I laughed.
Holocaust denial?
The Flat Earth folks?
The Elvis-is-alive people?
I should study them?
And these two guys said,
""Yeah, we're intrigued.
What are they about?
What's their objective?
How do they manage to get people
to believe what they say?""




 3:13


So thinking, if they thought
it was worthwhile,
I would take a momentary diversion 
maybe a year, maybe two,
three, maybe even four 
in academic terms, that's momentary.




 3:25


(Laughter)




 3:27


We work very slowly.




 3:29


(Laughter)




 3:31


And I would look at them.
So I did.
I did my research, and I came up
with a number of things,
two of which I'd like to share
with you today.




 3:39


One:
deniers are wolves in sheep's clothing.
They are the same: Nazis, neo-Nazis 
you can decide whether you want
to put a ""neo"" there or not.
But when I looked at them,
I didn't see any SS-like uniforms,
swastika-like symbols on the wall,
Sieg Heil salutes 
none of that.
What I found instead
were people parading
as respectable academics.




 4:15


What did they have?
They had an institute.
An ""Institute for Historical Review.""
They had a journal  a slick journal 
a ""Journal of Historical Review.""
One filled with papers 
footnote-laden papers.
And they had a new name.
Not neo-Nazis,
not anti-Semites 
revisionists.
They said, ""We are revisionists.
We are out to do one thing:
to revise mistakes in history.""
But all you had to do was go
one inch below the surface,
and what did you find there?
The same adulation of Hitler,
praise of the Third Reich,
anti-Semitism, racism, prejudice.
This is what intrigued me.
It was anti-Semitism, racism, prejudice,
parading as rational discourse.




 5:19


The other thing I found 
many of us have been taught to think
there are facts and there are opinions 
after studying deniers,
I think differently.
There are facts,
there are opinions,
and there are lies.
And what deniers want to do
is take their lies,
dress them up as opinions 
maybe edgy opinions,
maybe sort of out-of-the-box opinions 
but then if they're opinions,
they should be part of the conversation.
And then they encroach on the facts.




 5:54


I published my work 
the book was published,
""Denying the Holocaust: The Growing
Assault on Truth and Memory,""
it came out in many different countries,
including here in Penguin UK,
and I was done with those folks
and ready to move on.
Then came the letter from Penguin UK.
And for the third time, I laughed ...
mistakenly.
I opened the letter,
and it informed me that David Irving
was bringing a libel suit against me
in the United Kingdom
for calling him a Holocaust denier.




 6:32


David Irving suing me?
Who was David Irving?
David Irving was a writer
of historical works,
most of them about World War II,
and virtually all of those works
took the position
that the Nazis were really not so bad,
and the Allies were really not so good.
And the Jews, whatever happened to them,
they sort of deserved it.
He knew the documents,
he knew the facts,
but he somehow twisted them
to get this opinion.
He hadn't always been a Holocaust denier,
but in the late '80s,
he embraced it with great vigor.




 7:10


The reason I laughed also
was this was a man
who not only was a Holocaust denier,
but seemed quite proud of it.
Here was a man  and I quote 
who said, ""I'm going to sink
the battleship Auschwitz.""
Here was a man
who pointed to the number tattooed
on a survivor's arm and said,
""How much money have you made
from having that number
tattooed on your arm?""
Here was a man who said,
""More people died in Senator Kennedy's car
at Chappaquiddick
than died in gas chambers at Auschwitz.""
That's an American reference,
but you can look it up.
This was not a man who seemed
at all ashamed or reticent
about being a Holocaust denier.




 7:56


Now, lots of my academic
colleagues counseled me 
""Eh, Deborah, just ignore it.""
When I explained you can't just
ignore a libel suit,
they said, ""Who's going to
believe him anyway?""
But here was the problem:
British law put the onus,
put the burden of proof on me
to prove the truth of what I said,
in contrast to as it would have
been in the United States
and in many other countries:
on him to prove the falsehood.




 8:26


What did that mean?
That meant if I didn't fight,
he would win by default.
And if he won by default,
he could then legitimately say,
""My David Irving version of the Holocaust
is a legitimate version.
Deborah Lipstadt was found
to have libeled me
when she called me a Holocaust denier.
Ipso facto, I, David Irving,
am not a Holocaust denier.""
And what is that version?
There was no plan to murder the Jews,
there were no gas chambers,
there were no mass shootings,
Hitler had nothing to do
with any suffering that went on,
and the Jews have made this all up
to get money from Germany
and to get a state,
and they've done it with the aid
and abettance of the Allies 
they've planted the documents
and planted the evidence.




 9:21


I couldn't let that stand
and ever face a survivor
or a child of survivors.
I couldn't let that stand
and consider myself
a responsible historian.
So we fought.
And for those of you
who haven't seen ""Denial,""
spoiler alert:
we won.




 9:42


(Laughter)




 9:44


(Applause)




 9:50


The judge found David Irving
to be a liar,
a racist,
an anti-Semite.
His view of history was tendentious,
he lied, he distorted 
and most importantly,
he did it deliberately.
We showed a pattern,
in over 25 different major instances.
Not small things  many of us
in this audience write books,
are writing books;
we always make mistakes, that's why
we're glad to have second editions:
correct the mistakes.




10:23


(Laughter)




10:25


But these always moved
in the same direction:
blame the Jews,
exonerate the Nazis.




10:34


But how did we win?
What we did is follow his footnotes
back to his sources.
And what did we find?
Not in most cases,
and not in the preponderance of cases,
but in every single instance where
he made some reference to the Holocaust,
that his supposed evidence was distorted,
half-truth,
date-changed,
sequence-changed,
someone put at a meeting who wasn't there.
In other words,
he didn't have the evidence.
His evidence didn't prove it.
We didn't prove what happened.
We proved that what he said happened 
and by extension, all deniers,
because he either quotes them
or they get their arguments from him 
is not true.
What they claim 
they don't have the evidence to prove it.




11:27


So why is my story
more than just the story
of a quirky, long,
six-year, difficult lawsuit,
an American professor
being dragged into a courtroom
by a man that the court
declared in its judgment
was a neo-Nazi polemicist?
What message does it have?
I think in the context
of the question of truth,
it has a very significant message.
Because today,
as we well know,
truth and facts are under assault.
Social media, for all
the gifts it has given us,
has also allowed the difference
between facts  established facts 
and lies
to be flattened.




12:15


Third of all:
extremism.
You may not see Ku Klux Klan robes,
you may not see burning crosses,
you may not even hear outright
white supremacist language.
It may go by names: ""alt-right,""
""National Front""  pick your names.
But underneath, it's that same extremism
that I found in Holocaust denial
parading as rational discourse.




12:46


We live in an age
where truth is on the defensive.
I'm reminded of a New Yorker cartoon.
A quiz show recently appeared
in ""The New Yorker""
where the host of the quiz show
is saying to one of the contestants,
""Yes, ma'am, you had the right answer.
But your opponent yelled
more loudly than you did,
so he gets the point.""




13:07


What can we do?
First of all,
we cannot be beguiled
by rational appearances.
We've got to look underneath,
and we will find there the extremism.
Second of all,
we must understand
that truth is not relative.
Number three,
we must go on the offensive,
not the defensive.
When someone makes an outrageous claim,
even though they may hold
one of the highest offices in the land,
if not the world 
we must say to them,
""Where's the proof?
Where's the evidence?""
We must hold their feet to the fire.
We must not treat it as if their lies
are the same as the facts.




14:02


And as I said earlier,
truth is not relative.
Many of us have grown up
in the world of the academy
and enlightened liberal thought,
where we're taught
everything is open to debate.
But that's not the case.
There are certain things that are true.
There are indisputable facts 
objective truths.
Galileo taught it to us centuries ago.
Even after being forced
to recant by the Vatican
that the Earth moved around the Sun,
he came out,
and what is he reported to have said?
""And yet, it still moves.""




14:46


The Earth is not flat.
The climate is changing.
Elvis is not alive.




14:54


(Laughter)




14:56


(Applause)




14:58


And most importantly,
truth and fact are under assault.
The job ahead of us,
the task ahead of us,
the challenge ahead of us
is great.
The time to fight is short.
We must act now.
Later will be too late.




15:23


Thank you very much.

Gayle King: Have a seat, Serena Williams,
or should we say, have a seat, mom.




 0:17


(Cheers)




 0:20


So no doubt, you guys are like me.
You saw the release of Serena
in that great yellow
bathing suit last week
and when I saw it,
all I could think of was,
""Gosh, why couldn't she have waited
til we sat onstage for TED?""
I was very selfish, I know.
So I asked you about that picture,
and you said nobody was
supposed to see that picture.
What do you mean?




 0:41


Serena Williams: Well,
actually, it was an accident.
I was on vacation,
just taking some time for myself,
and I have this thing
where I've been checking my status
and taking pictures every week
to see how far along I'm going 




 0:55


GK: And sharing it with friends, maybe?




 0:57


SW: No, actually
I have just been saving it,
and I didn't really tell a lot of people,
to be quite honest,
and I'd been saving it,
and you know how social media is,
you press the wrong button and 




 1:08


(Laughter)




 1:09


GK: And there it was.




 1:10


SW: So 30 minutes later 
my phone doesn't ring that much 
and 30 minutes later,
I missed like four calls,
and I'm like, that's weird,
and then I picked it up
and I was like, oh no.
But it was a good moment.
I was gonna wait literally
just five or six more days  that's OK.




 1:25


GK: I know, because it was weird,
Serena, because it only said 20 weeks,
so it's not like there was
a whole lot of information on it.




 1:31


SW: Exactly, so that's
what I've been doing all this time.
I've been just tracking it.
18, 19  every week
I'd just take a picture and save it,
and I've been so good about it,
and this was the one time that I slipped.




 1:45


GK: There you go. Well, congratulations.




 1:47


SW: Yes, thank you.




 1:49


GK: It really is OK.
When you heard the news,
were you excited?
Were you afraid? Were you worried?
That you were pregnant, I mean.




 1:55


SW: So I heard it two days before
the beginning of the Australian Open,
which is one of the biggest grand slams.




 2:02


GK: You found out two days before?




 2:03


SW: Yeah, so it was
two days before, and I knew.
I was nervous.
I wasn't quite sure what to think,
but I just knew that at that moment
it was really important for me
to just focus right there
at the Australian Open,
and I was definitely not sure what to do.
I was like, can I play?
I know it's very dangerous, maybe,
sometimes in the first 12 weeks or so,
so I had a lot of questions.




 2:29


GK: But not only did you play,
Ms. Williams, you won.




 2:33


(Cheers)




 2:36


SW: Yeah.
May I just say, 23 grand slams to you.




 2:43


SW: Thank you.




 2:44


(Applause)




 2:46


GK: While pregnant!




 2:47


SW: Well, I was looking
for another handicap, so ... no.




 2:50


GK: Did you play differently that game,
knowing you were pregnant?




 2:53


SW: I did. It wasn't very easy.
You hear all these stories
about people when they're pregnant,
they get sick and they get tired.




 3:00


GK: Have you had morning sickness?




 3:02


SW: No, I've been so fortunate
and so I haven't.
But they get really tired
and they get really stressed out,
and I had to really take all that energy,
put it in a paper bag, so to say,
and throw it away,
because I really felt
like I didn't have time
to deal with any extra emotions,
any extra anything,
because pregnant or not, no one knew,
and I was supposed to win that tournament
as I am every tournament that I show up.
I am expected to win,
and if I don't win,
it's actually much bigger news.




 3:29


GK: Yeah, when you don't win,
that's a big story.




 3:32


SW: Yes, so for me,
I had to really take anything negative
and any emotions
that I was feeling at that point
and kind of just bottle them up
and really figure out
what the next step for me to do was.




 3:43


GK: You have a lot of support.
You have a lot of love.
Even when I was coming here,
people stopped me at the airport.
I was saying to the flight attendant,
the pilot, ""Guess where I'm going?""
They said, ""Oh my God,
we're so glad she's pregnant.""
But then you always have
these cranky Yankees.
On the way over here, somebody
was telling me about Ilie Nastase,
who said some very unkind, inappropriate,
dare I say racial things.
You have responded to him.
I'm not even going
to dignify what he said,
but you responded. Why did you respond?




 4:08


SW: Well, I think there are
very inappropriate comments,
and not only that, I've been
really supportive of my peers
and the people that I've worked with.
I've been a pro for almost 20 years,
and so for me, it's really important
to hold women up,
and it's something that these young women,
they'll come to the locker room,
they'll want to take pictures with me,
and for me, it's just like,
I want to be able to be a good leader
and a good example for them.
So not only 




 4:31


(Applause)




 4:32


Not only did he have rude things
to say about me and my peers,
I felt it was important
for us to stand up for each other
and to stand up for myself.
And at that point it was
really important for me to say,
like, I'm not afraid,
I'm not going anywhere,
but this is inappropriate,
and there's time and there's
a place for everything.
And that really
wasn't the time and the place.




 4:54


GK: We cut the part where you said
you're not going anywhere,
because you'll be 36 in September.
Baby's coming, 36.
And your coach said
age is always important,
but in tennis it's very important,
but he has no doubt
that you're coming back.
Have you thought, am I coming back?
Will I take some time off?
I know the women on the tour are saying,
""How long does it take to have a baby?
Two years will she be gone?""
What are you thinking?




 5:15


SW: Well, I'm always trying
to defy the odds, you know,
so for me everything is really mental.
I definitely plan on coming back.
I'm not done yet.
I'm really inspired by my sister.
She's a year older than me,
and that's something that 
if she's still playing, I know I can play.




 5:29


(Laughter)




 5:31


And there's so many  Roger Federer,
he's a little bit older than me
and he's still winning everything,
so I'm like, I know I can do that too.
So that's been so inspiring to me,
especially recently,
and I know that
it's something I want to do.
And my story is definitely not over yet.
I was talking to my coach about it,
and we were talking about
how this is just a new part of my life,
and my baby's going to be in the stands
and hopefully cheering for me,
not crying too much.




 5:58


GK: No, you wrote a beautiful
letter to your baby yesterday
that you said  from the oldest mommy
to the youngest one,
to the oldest, to the youngest,
I can't wait for you to get here.
A lot of people feel that.
I saw you about a year ago,
because I think about your life, Serena.
You've had three life-changing things
in a six-month time:
pregnant, huge win, fell in love.
And when I saw you last year,
I was saying, ""How's
your love life? Da da da.""
You said, ""I met a guy.
He's a nerdy, kinda geeky guy.
You won't know who he is.""
I said, ""What's his name?""




 6:28


SW: I remember talking
to you about that, yes.




 6:30


GK: And you said, ""Alexis Ohanian.""
I said, ""I know him!"" He's awesome.
But I would never put you
with a nerdy geek,
and you said, you neither.




 6:38


SW: I'm going to be honest
with you, I didn't either,
but it's been the best thing for me.




 6:42


GK: The best thing why?
Does that look like a nerdy geek?
Look at the shirt.




 6:47


(Laughter)




 6:48


No, he's a very nice guy.




 6:49


SW: You can tell he's into technology.




 6:51


GK: He's a very, very nice guy.
I like him very much.
So how did he succeed
when others have failed?
How was he the one that you knew,
this is the one for me?




 7:00


SW: Well, I'm not going to say that,
but ...




 7:04


(Laughter)




 7:05


GK: Say it, Serena, say it!




 7:07


SW: Well ...




 7:08


(Laughter)




 7:11


Yes.




 7:13


(Applause)




 7:16


GK: But you know what I mean.




 7:17


SW: He is very loving and he's very kind,
and my mom says he's very considerate,
and when she said that to me,
I was like, you know, he really is,
and it's the little things that really
make a huge difference in life.




 7:28


GK: Like?




 7:29


SW: Something simple.
My fashion company,
we have a show every year,
so in our show last year,
I was running around like crazy,
because I do everything for the show,
and everything for it,
so I was running around like crazy,
and he, it was a simple gesture
of this shirt that he had,
and he just wanted to make sure
that I had the same one,
and it was  it's a weird story.
It was better in person, I promise.




 7:53


GK: Was it a wonderful proposal?
Or was it a Beyonc song?
""If you like it then you
ought to put a ring on it""?
Were you feeling pressure to get married?
Did you know it was coming?




 8:03


SW: Yeah, I actually
never felt pressure to get married
and I can't say
I'm the marrying type of person.
I really love my life.
I love my freedom.
I heard that kind of changes.
But I love everything that I do,
and I love my career,
and I always felt like I didn't want
anything to interfere with that.
I've actually been so career-oriented
and in fact, when he proposed,
I was almost angry.
Not almost. I was angry,
because it was right
in the middle of my training season,
and I said, ""I gotta win
the Australian Open.
I can't fly to Rome.""
Because he wanted to take me to Rome,
and I said, ""I can't. I gotta win.""
But that's how focused I was.




 8:41


GK: This is a girl that says,
""No, I can't go to Rome."" OK.




 8:44


SW: But I was really focused
on reaching my goals
and I knew at that point there was
one player that I wanted to pass.
I wanted to pass Steffi Graf's record,
and that really meant a lot to me,
and when I put my mind to something,
I really am determined to reach it
no matter what.




 8:59


GK: You know, you said that for you 
I've heard you say
that winning is addictive to you.




 9:04


SW: It is.




 9:05


GK: What do you mean?




 9:06


SW: I feel like winning for me
is superaddictive.
I feel like once you experience it,
you always want to get that feeling again,
and when I won my first championship,
I was only 17 years old,
but I never forgot that feeling,
and I feel like every time I win one,
I want to reach that feeling
of your first championship.
There's really no feeling
in the world like that.
And it's like, all these years of training
and being a little kid and playing,
and then winning
is a wonderful experience.
So for me I've always felt
like I loved that feeling,
and obviously I don't like
the feeling of losing. I feel like 




 9:43


GK: No, in fact, people close to you
say you're a very bad loser.




 9:46


SW: I'm not the best loser.




 9:48


GK: That you're very, very, very bad.
Listen, no athlete,
no champion likes to lose.
I get that.
But they say when it comes to losing,
you are very, very, very bad at it.




 9:57


(Laughter)




 9:59


SW: I'm number one at losing too,
so you know, that's all I can say.




10:02


(Laughter)




10:04


(Applause)




10:06


GK: I'm always curious about the dynamic
between you and Venus,
because everybody that knows you
and has followed the story
knows that you two are very close,
and you always bring your A game
in whatever you do,
but I often wonder,
when you're playing her,
do you bring your A- game
because you want to do something for her
or do you bring your A++ game
because you want to crush her.
Is it harder for you
playing her or easier?




10:28


SW: Well, playing Venus
is like playing myself,
because we grew up playing each other,
we grew up practicing together.
And it was something
that has been difficult,
because she's my toughest opponent.
She's tall, she's fast,
she hits hard like me, she serves like me.
It's really like playing a wall.




10:44


GK: She knows you.




10:45


SW: She knows where I'm hitting
the ball before I hit it,
so it's something that is not very easy,
but it's really about,
when I go out there,
I really have to shut down my mind
and I have to say to myself,
""You know what?
I'm just playing a great player,
but today I have to be better.
I don't care who it is,
if it's my sister or it's my friend,
today is the day I have to show up
and I have to be better
and I have to want it more
than anyone else at this moment
anywhere on this world.""




11:13


GK: So never on the court
do you fall back for Venus?
Because, you know,
it was always Venus and Serena.




11:21


SW: Yes.




11:23


GK: And now baby sister
has surpassed older sister.
Do you feel guilt about that?
Do you feel joy in that?
Is that a difficult position for you?




11:30


SW: I don't feel anything in there.
In my life, it still and forever
is always going to be Venus and Serena.
She's really love of my life,
she's my best friend,
she's my soul mate.
I mean 
There's pictures of her pushing me,
really low-quality pictures
or else I would have shared them,
of her pushing me
in a stroller on a tennis court,
and she always took care of me.
I used to spend all of my allowance
money on the ice cream truck and stuff,
and she would take her money
and give it to me at school
and make sure I had something to eat
and she would go without,
and that's the kind of person
she actually is
since I've always known her.
So we always have this incredible
respect for each other
and this incredible love,
and I think it's important for people
to realize you can be successful
but you can still have
a wonderful relationship.
On the court we are mortal enemies,
but the second we shake hands,
we are best friends again.
And if I lose, it might be
a day later for me,
but for Venus 




12:28


(Laughter)




12:31


GK: There's never a time on the court
where you hit the ball
and say, ""That's for seventh grade
when you did the blah blah blah""?
You never have any moment like that?




12:39


SW: I feel like she should have
those moments,
because she's never done
anything bad to me,
but I'm the youngest.
I'm the younger sister.




12:46


GK: Serena, she's never done
anything bad to you? Really?
I have three sisters.
I can think of some stuff I've done bad.




12:52


SW: Unless she brainwashed me
to forget them.




12:55


GK: No, but the love you have for her
I know is very pure. I know that.




12:58


SW: Yes. GK: I know that.




12:59


SW: We were always brought up
to be superclose,
and we are incredibly close.
Not only her.
I have three other sisters as well,
and we were always so close.




13:10


GK: So before a big match,
the two of you don't get together
and say, look, we're going
to go out there and  there's nothing?




13:16


SW: Well, it's funny.
Before the Australian Open,
we were in the locker room together,
and I always pick on her, so I pulled out
my camera while she was changing.
I started taking pictures of her,
which is totally inappropriate,
but she was so mad at me.
She's like, ""Serena, stop!""
And I was just laughing at her.
But that's the kind of relationship
that we have, and like I said,
the second we step on the court,
it was like, we were
definitely mortal enemies,
but the second we stepped off,
and moments before, we're just 
It is what it is,
because at the end of the day,
she'll always be my sister.
I'm not going to play Australia in 
Well, who knows,
I've been playing forever,
but I don't think
I'll be playing in 50 years, say?
Let's be safe and say 50 years.




13:56


GK: I don't know, Serena.
There's never been anybody like you.
When you think about it,
never been anybody
who has intersected
gender and race the way you have,
the dominance that you have
and the scrutiny that you have.
And when you were growing up,
did you say, ""I want to be like that""?
Because now little girls
are looking at you
saying, ""I want to be like that.""
Who was the ""I want
to be like that"" for you?




14:16


SW: Well, it's interesting,
and I'm glad you brought that up.
For me, when I grew up,
I always wanted to be the best,
and I said, if you want to be the best,
you've got to emulate the best.
So when I started to go on tour
when I was really young,
I would see Steffi Graf,
I would see Monica Seles,
and I would even see Pete Sampras,
and I would see what they did,
and I noticed that Steffi and Monica
didn't really talk
to a lot of the other players,
and they kind of were on their own,
and they were just so focused
and I would see Pete Sampras,
the technique that he did,
and I was like, ""I want to do that.""
So I did that, and I felt
that to be the best,
and if you want to be the best,
you have to hang around people
and you have to look at people
that are the best,
because you're not going to be the best
if you're looking at someone
that's not at the top level.




15:01


GK: People say
nobody works as hard as you.




15:03


SW: I'm a very hard worker.
GK: That's what I heard.




15:05


SW: People say, ""Oh,
she's talented, she's athletic.""
Actually, I wasn't.
I was really small for my age.
I grew up when I got older,
and I had to work really hard,
and I think one of the reasons
why I fight so hard and I work so hard
is because I was
really, really, really small.




15:19


GK: Yeah.
You are no longer small.




15:22


SW: No, I'm fully grown now.
But I was small when I was really young
for whatever reason.
I think Venus maybe ate all the Wheaties.




15:31


GK: You know, the other thing
people talk about is your body.
Your body brings men
and women to their knees.
And I mean in a good way.
A lot has been made about your body.
It's a work of art,
it's masculine, it's glorious,
there's never been anything like it.
Did you have body issues
when you were growing up?
Have you always been
comfortable with your body?




15:54


SW: It's interesting, because
when you're a teenage female
growing up in the public eye,
it is a lot of scrutiny that you face,
and as any female that's a teenager,
I definitely was not
comfortable in my body.
I didn't like it.
I didn't understand why I had muscles.
And I stopped lifting weights.
I was like, I'm not going to do this.
But then after I won the US Open,
I realized that my body helped me
reach goals that I wanted to reach,
and I wanted to be happy with it,
and I was so appreciative of it.
I'm always healthy.
I'm really fortunate and superblessed,
and I felt like not only
am I happy with my body,
but I want other people
and other young girls
that have experienced
what I've experienced
to be happy with themselves.
So whatever people say 
masculine, whatever,
too much, too little 
I'm OK with it as long as I love myself.




16:41


(Applause)




16:45


GK: I know you learn a lot from winning,
but what have you learned from losing?




16:50


SW: I hate to lose, but I think
losing has brought me here today.
The only reason I am who I am
is because of my losses,
and some of them are extremely painful,
but I wouldn't take any of them away,
because every time I lose,
it takes a really long time
for me to lose again
because I learn so much from it.
And I encourage everyone that I talk to 
I'm like, listen, if you lose
or if something happens 
not in sports 
in business or in school 
learn from it.
Don't live in the past,
live in the present,
and don't make the same
mistakes in the future.
That's something
that I always try to live by.




17:25


GK: Now you're planning a wedding
and I want to know,
is it a destination wedding
in the Catskills or Poconos
or are you going to do it in Florida?
What are you thinking?
Big or small?




17:36


SW: We're thinking medium size.
We don't want to do too big,
but then we're like, OK, we can't
say no to this person, this person.
So we're thinking medium size
and we're just thinking 
My personality is a lot of fun.
Hopefully you can see that today.
I'm not too serious.




17:49


GK: And you like to dance.
And the next chapter
for Serena Williams is what?




17:54


SW: Oh, next for me.
Obviously I'm going to have a baby
and I'm going to stay fit
and kind of come back and play tennis
and keep working on my fashion line.
That'll be really fun.




18:04


GK: Do you know if it's a boy or girl?




18:06


SW: I don't. I have a feeling
of one or the other.
It's a 50-50 chance, but I have a feeling.




18:12


GK: Gayle is a unisex name.
Whatever you and Alexis decide,
we are cheering you on!




18:16


SW: Thank you for that.
GK: You're welcome.
We are cheering you on, Serena Williams.
SW: Thank you so much.




18:21


Thank you guys.

How many people here would like to live
to be at least 80 years old?
Yeah.
I think we all have
this hopeful expectation
of living into old age.
Let's project out into the future,
to your future ""you's,""
and let's imagine that we're all 85.
Now, everyone look at two people.
One of you probably has
Alzheimer's disease.




 0:38


(Laughter)




 0:41


Alright, alright.
And maybe you're thinking,
""Well, it won't be me.""
Then, OK. You are a caregiver.
So 




 0:53


(Laughter)




 0:56


so in some way,
this terrifying disease
is likely to affect us all.




 1:01


Part of the fear around Alzheimer's
stems from the sense
that there's nothing we can do about it.
Despite decades of research, we still
have no disease-modifying treatment
and no cure.
So if we're lucky enough
to live long enough,
Alzheimer's appears to be
our brain's destiny.




 1:20


But maybe it doesn't have to be.
What if I told you we could
change these statistics,
literally change our brain's destiny,
without relying on a cure
or advancements in medicine?




 1:32


Let's begin by looking at
what we currently understand
about the neuroscience of Alzheimer's.
Here's a picture
of two neurons connecting.
The point of connection,
this space circled in red,
is called the synapse.
The synapse is where
neurotransmitters are released.
This is where signals are transmitted,
where communication happens.
This is where we think,
feel, see, hear, desire ...
and remember.
And the synapse
is where Alzheimer's happens.




 2:04


Let's zoom in on the synapse
and look at a cartoon representation
of what's going on.
During the business
of communicating information,
in addition to releasing neurotransmitters
like glutamate into the synapse,
neurons also release a small peptide
called amyloid beta.
Normally, amyloid beta is cleared away
metabolized by microglia,
the janitor cells of our brains.
While the molecular causes
of Alzheimer's are still debated,
most neuroscientists believe
that the disease begins
when amyloid beta begins to accumulate.
Too much is released,
or not enough is cleared away,
and the synapse begins
to pile up with amyloid beta.
And when this happens, it binds to itself,
forming sticky aggregates
called amyloid plaques.




 2:52


How many people here
are 40 years old or older?
You're afraid to admit it now.
This initial step into the disease,
this presence of amyloid
plaques accumulating,
can already be found in your brains.
The only way we could be sure of this
would be through a PET scan,
because at this point,
you are blissfully unaware.
You're not showing any impairments
in memory, language, or cognition ...
yet.
We think it takes at least 15 to 20 years
of amyloid plaque accumulation
before it reaches a tipping point,
then triggering a molecular cascade
that causes the clinical
symptoms of the disease.
Prior to the tipping point,
your lapses in memory
might include things like,
""Why did I come in this room?""
or ""Oh ... what's his name?""
or ""Where did I put my keys?""




 3:46


Now, before you all
start freaking out again,
because I know half of you did at least
one of those in the last 24 hours 
these are all normal kinds of forgetting.
In fact, I would argue that these examples
might not even involve your memory,
because you didn't pay attention
to where you put your keys
in the first place.
After the tipping point,
the glitches in memory,
language and cognition are different.
Instead of eventually finding
your keys in your coat pocket
or on the table by the door,
you find them in the refrigerator,
or you find them and you think,
""What are these for?""




 4:23


So what happens when amyloid plaques
accumulate to this tipping point?
Our microglia janitor cells
become hyper-activated,
releasing chemicals that cause
inflammation and cellular damage.
We think they might actually
start clearing away
the synapses themselves.
A crucial neural transport protein
called ""tau"" becomes hyperphosphorylated
and twists itself
into something called ""tangles,""
which choke off the neurons
from the inside.
By mid-stage Alzheimer's,
we have massive inflammation and tangles
and all-out war at the synapse
and cell death.




 4:59


So if you were a scientist
trying to cure this disease,
at what point would you ideally
want to intervene?
Many scientists are betting big
on the simplest solution:
keep amyloid plaques
from reaching that tipping point,
which means that drug discovery is largely
focused on developing a compound
that will prevent, eliminate, or reduce
amyloid plaque accumulation.
So the cure for Alzheimer's will likely be
a preventative medicine.
We're going to have to take this pill
before we reach that tipping point,
before the cascade is triggered,
before we start leaving
our keys in the refrigerator.
We think this is why, to date,
these kinds of drugs have failed
in clinical trials 
not because the science wasn't sound,
but because the people in these trials
were already symptomatic.
It was too late.
Think of amyloid plaques as a lit match.
At the tipping point, the match
sets fire to the forest.
Once the forest is ablaze,
it doesn't do any good
to blow out the match.
You have to blow out the match
before the forest catches fire.




 6:07


Even before scientists sort this out,
this information is actually
really good news for us,
because it turns out that the way we live
can influence the accumulation
of amyloid plaques.
And so there are things we can do
to keep us from reaching
that tipping point.




 6:22


Let's picture your risk
of Alzheimer's as a see-saw scale.
We're going to pile
risk factors on one arm,
and when that arm hits the floor,
you are symptomatic
and diagnosed with Alzheimer's.
Let's imagine you're 50 years old.
You're not a spring chicken anymore,
so you've accumulated
some amyloid plaques with age.
Your scale is tipped a little bit.




 6:43


Now let's look at your DNA.
We've all inherited our genes
from our moms and our dads.
Some of these genes will increase our risk
and some will decrease it.
If you're like Alice in ""Still Alice,""
you've inherited a rare genetic mutation
that cranks out amyloid beta,
and this alone will tip
your scale arm to the ground.
But for most of us, the genes we inherit
will only tip the arm a bit.
For example, APOE4 is a gene variant
that increases amyloid,
but you can inherit a copy of APOE4
from mom and dad
and still never get Alzheimer's,
which means that for most of us,
our DNA alone does not determine
whether we get Alzheimer's.
So what does?
We can't do anything about getting older
or the genes we've inherited.
So far, we haven't changed
our brain's destiny.




 7:34


What about sleep?
In slow-wave deep sleep, our glial cells
rinse cerebral spinal fluid
throughout our brains,
clearing away metabolic waste
that accumulated in our synapses
while we were awake.
Deep sleep is like
a power cleanse for the brain.
But what happens if you shortchange
yourself on sleep?
Many scientists believe
that poor sleep hygiene might actually
be a predictor of Alzheimer's.
A single night of sleep deprivation
leads to an increase in amyloid beta.
And amyloid accumulation
has been shown to disrupt sleep,
which in turn causes
more amyloid to accumulate.
And so now we have
this positive feedback loop
that's going to accelerate
the tipping of that scale.




 8:18


What else?
Cardiovascular health.
High blood pressure, diabetes,
obesity, smoking, high cholesterol,
have all been shown to increase our risk
of developing Alzheimer's.
Some autopsy studies have shown
that as many as 80 percent
of people with Alzheimer's
also had cardiovascular disease.
Aerobic exercise has been shown
in many studies to decrease amyloid beta
in animal models of the disease.
So a heart-healthy
Mediterranean lifestyle and diet
can help to counter
the tipping of this scale.




 8:51


So there are many things we can do
to prevent or delay
the onset of Alzheimer's.
But let's say
you haven't done any of them.
Let's say you're 65;
there's Alzheimer's in your family,
so you've likely inherited a gene or two
that tips your scale arm a bit;
you've been burning the candle
at both ends for years;
you love bacon;
and you don't run unless
someone's chasing you.




 9:13


(Laughter)




 9:15


Let's imagine that your amyloid plaques
have reached that tipping point.
Your scale arm has crashed to the floor.
You've tripped the cascade,
setting fire to the forest,
causing inflammation, tangles,
and cell death.
You should be symptomatic for Alzheimer's.
You should be having trouble
finding words and keys
and remembering what I said
at the beginning of this talk.
But you might not be.




 9:40


There's one more thing you can do
to protect yourself
from experiencing
the symptoms of Alzheimer's,
even if you have the full-blown disease
pathology ablaze in your brain.
It has to do with neural plasticity
and cognitive reserve.
Remember, the experience
of having Alzheimer's
is ultimately a result of losing synapses.
The average brain has
over a hundred trillion synapses,
which is fantastic;
we've got a lot to work with.
And this isn't a static number.
We gain and lose synapses all the time,
through a process
called neural plasticity.
Every time we learn something new,
we are creating and strengthening
new neural connections,
new synapses.




10:21


In the Nun Study,
678 nuns, all over the age of 75
when the study began,
were followed for more than two decades.
They were regularly given
physical checkups and cognitive tests,
and when they died, their brains
were all donated for autopsy.
In some of these brains, scientists
discovered something surprising.
Despite the presence of plaques
and tangles and brain shrinkage 
what appeared to be
unquestionable Alzheimer's 
the nuns who had belonged
to these brains showed no signs
of having the disease
while they were alive.




10:57


How can this be?
We think it's because these nuns
had a high level of cognitive reserve,
which is a way of saying that they had
more functional synapses.
People who have more years
of formal education,
who have a high degree of literacy,
who engage regularly
in mentally stimulating activities,
all have more cognitive reserve.
They have an abundance
and a redundancy in neural connections.
So even if they have a disease
like Alzheimer's
compromising some of their synapses,
they've got many extra backup connections,
and this buffers them from noticing
that anything is amiss.




11:33


Let's imagine a simplified example.
Let's say you only know one thing
about a subject.
Let's say it's about me.
You know that Lisa Genova
wrote ""Still Alice,""
and that's the only thing
you know about me.
You have that single neural connection,
that one synapse.
Now imagine you have Alzheimer's.
You have plaques and tangles
and inflammation
and microglia devouring that synapse.
Now when someone asks you,
""Hey, who wrote 'Still Alice?'""
you can't remember,
because that synapse
is either failing or gone.
You've forgotten me forever.




12:08


But what if you had learned more about me?
Let's say you learned
four things about me.
Now imagine you have Alzheimer's,
and three of those synapses
are damaged or destroyed.
You still have a way
to detour the wreckage.
You can still remember my name.
So we can be resilient
to the presence of Alzheimer's pathology
through the recruitment
of yet-undamaged pathways.
And we create these pathways,
this cognitive reserve,
by learning new things.
Ideally, we want these new things
to be as rich in meaning as possible,
recruiting sight and sound
and associations and emotion.




12:47


So this really doesn't mean
doing crossword puzzles.
You don't want to simply retrieve
information you've already learned,
because this is like traveling
down old, familiar streets,
cruising neighborhoods you already know.
You want to pave new neural roads.
Building an Alzheimer's-resistant brain
means learning to speak Italian,
meeting new friends,
reading a book,
or listening to a great TED Talk.

And if, despite all of this, you are
someday diagnosed with Alzheimer's,
there are three lessons I've learned
from my grandmother
and the dozens of people I've come to know
living with this disease.
Diagnosis doesn't mean
you're dying tomorrow.
Keep living.
You won't lose your emotional memory.
You'll still be able
to understand love and joy.
You might not remember
what I said five minutes ago,
but you'll remember how I made you feel.
And you are more than what
you can remember.

Thank you.

2772,Laura Galante,How to exploit democracy,http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/2772,"Hacking, fake news, information bubbles ... all these and more have become part of the vernacular in recent years. But as cyberspace analyst Laura Galante describes in this alarming talk, the real target of anyone looking to influence geopolitics is dastardly simple: it's you.",http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/2770/transcript?language=en,5,2017,TED2017,0:09:33,5/3/17,647477,"global issues,politics,web,hack,news,Internet,government,policy,leadership,society,technology,computers,future,communication,intelligence,data,algorithm","0:12


Let's say you despise
Western democracy.
Democracy, in all its trappings,
free elections, town halls,
endless debates about
the proper role of government.
Too messy,
too unpredictable,
too constraining for your taste.
And the way these democracies
band together and lecture everyone else
about individual rights and freedoms 
it gets under your skin.




 0:40


So what to do about it?
You can call out the hypocrisy
and failures of Western democracies
and explain how your way is better,
but that's never really worked for you.
What if you could get the people
whose support is the very foundation
of these democracies
to start questioning the system?
Make the idea occur in their own minds
that democracy and its institutions
are failing them,
their elite are corrupt puppet masters
and the country they knew is in free fall.
To do that,
you'll need to infiltrate
the information spheres
of these democracies.
You'll need to turn
their most powerful asset 
an open mind 
into their greatest vulnerability.
You'll need people to question the truth.




 1:35


Now, you'll be familiar of hacking
and leaks that happened in 2016.
One was the Democratic
National Committee's networks,
and the personal email
accounts of its staff,
later released on WikiLeaks.
After that, various online personas,
like a supposed Romanian cybercriminal
who didn't speak Romanian,
aggressively pushed news
of these leaks to journalists.
The media took the bait.
They were consumed by how much
the DNC hated Bernie.
At the time, it was that narrative
that far outshined the news
that a group of Russian government
sponsored hackers
who we called ""Advanced
Persistent Threat 28,""
or ""APT28"" for short,
was carrying out
these operations against the US.




 2:23


And there was no shortage of evidence.
This group of Russian government hackers
hadn't just appeared out of nowhere
in 2016.
We had started tracking
this group back in 2014.
And the tools that APT28 used
to compromise its victims' networks
demonstrated a thoughtful,
well-resourced effort
that had taken place for now over a decade
in Moscow's time zone
from about 9 am to 6 pm.
APT28 loved to prey on the emails
and contacts of journalists in Chechnya,
the Georgian government,
eastern European defense attachs 
all targets with an undeniable interest
to the Russian government.




 3:02


We weren't the only ones onto this.
Governments, research teams
across the world,
were coming to similar conclusions
and observing the same
types of operations.
But what Russia was doing in 2016
went far beyond espionage.
The DNC hack was just one of many
where stolen data was posted online
accompanied by a sensational narrative,
then amplified in social media
for lightning-speed adoption by the media.
This didn't ring the alarm bells
that a nation-state was trying
to interfere with the credibility
of another's internal affairs.




 3:44


So why, collectively,
did we not see this coming?
Why did it take months
before Americans understood
that they were under a state-sponsored
information attack?
The easy answer is politics.
The Obama Administration was caught
in a perfect catch-22.
By raising the specter that the Russian
government was interfering
in the US presidential campaign,
the Administration risked appearing
to meddle in the campaign itself.
But the better answer, I think,
is that the US and the West
were utterly unequipped
to recognize and respond
to a modern information operation,
despite the fact that the US
had wielded information
with devastating success
in an era not so long ago.




 4:37


Look, so while the US and the West
spent the last 20 years
caught up in cybersecurity 
what networks to harden,
which infrastructure to deem critical,
how to set up armies of cyber warriors
and cyber commands 
Russia was thinking in far more
consequential terms.
Before the first iPhone
even hit the shelf,
the Russian government understood
the risks and the opportunity
that technology provided
and the inter-communication
and instant communication it provided us.




 5:11


As our realities are increasingly
based on the information
that we're consuming
at the palm of our hand
and from the news feeds
that we're scanning
and the hashtags and stories
that we see trending,
the Russian government
was the first to recognize
how this evolution
had turned your mind into the most
exploitable device on the planet.
And your mind is particularly exploitable
if you're accustomed
to an unfettered flow of information,
now increasingly curated
to your own tastes.
This panorama of information
that's so interesting to you
gives a state, or anyone for that matter,
a perfect back door into your mind.




 5:55


It's this new brand of state-sponsored
information operations
that can be that much more successful,
more insidious,
and harder for the target audience 
that includes the media 
to decipher and characterize.
If you can get a hashtag
trending on Twitter,
or chum the waters with fake news
directed to audiences
primed to receive it,
or drive journalists to dissect
terabytes of email
for a cent of impropriety 
all tactics used in Russian operations 
then you've got a shot at effectively
camouflaging your operations
in the mind of your target.
This is what Russia's long called
""reflexive control.""
It's the ability to use
information on someone else
so that they make a decision
on their own accord
that's favorable to you.
This is nation-state-grade image control
and perception management,
and it's conducted by any means,
with any tools, network-based
or otherwise, that will achieve it.




 7:00


Take this for another example.
In early February 2014, a few weeks
before Russia would invade Crimea,
a phone call is posted on YouTube.
In it, there's two US diplomats.
They sound like they're playing
kingmaker in Ukraine,
and worse, they curse the EU
for its lack of speed and leadership
in resolving the crisis.
The media covers the phone call,
and then the ensuing diplomatic backlash
leaves Washington and Europe reeling.
And it creates a fissured response
and a feckless attitude
towards Russia's land grab in Ukraine.
Mission accomplished.




 7:41


So while hacked phone calls
and emails and networks
keep grabbing the headlines,
the real operations are the ones
that are influencing
the decisions you make
and the opinions you hold,
all in the service of a nation-state's
strategic interest.
This is power in the information age.
And this information is all
that much more seductive,
all that much easier to take
at face value and pass on,
when it's authentic.
Who's not interested in the truth
that's presented in phone calls and emails
that were never intended
for public consumption?
But how meaningful is that truth
if you don't know why
it's being revealed to you?




 8:26


We must recognize that this place
where we're increasingly living,
which we've quaintly termed ""cyberspace,""
isn't defined by ones and zeroes,
but by information
and the people behind it.
This is far more than a network
of computers and devices.
This is a network composed of minds
interacting with computers and devices.




 8:49


And for this network,
there's no encryption,
there's no firewall,
no two-factor authentication,
no password complex enough to protect you.
What you have for defense
is far stronger, it's more adaptable,
it's always running the latest version.
It's the ability to think critically:
call out falsehood,
press for the facts.
And above all, you must have the courage
to unflinchingly pursue the truth.

Chris Anderson:
Elon, hey, welcome back to TED.
It's great to have you here.




 0:15


Elon Musk: Thanks for having me.




 0:17


CA: So, in the next half hour or so,
we're going to spend some time
exploring your vision for what
an exciting future might look like,
which I guess makes
the first question a little ironic:
Why are you boring?




 0:32


EM: Yeah.
I ask myself that frequently.
We're trying to dig a hole under LA,
and this is to create the beginning
of what will hopefully
be a 3D network of tunnels
to alleviate congestion.
So right now, one of the most
soul-destroying things is traffic.
It affects people
in every part of the world.
It takes away so much of your life.
It's horrible.
It's particularly horrible in LA.




 1:08


(Laughter)




 1:11


CA: I think you've brought with you
the first visualization
that's been shown of this.
Can I show this?




 1:17


EM: Yeah, absolutely.
So this is the first time 
Just to show what we're talking about.
So a couple of key things
that are important
in having a 3D tunnel network.
First of all, you have to be able
to integrate the entrance
and exit of the tunnel
seamlessly into the fabric of the city.
So by having an elevator,
sort of a car skate,
that's on an elevator,
you can integrate the entrance
and exits to the tunnel network
just by using two parking spaces.
And then the car gets on a skate.
There's no speed limit here,
so we're designing this to be able
to operate at 200 kilometers an hour.




 1:58


CA: How much?




 1:59


EM: 200 kilometers an hour,
or about 130 miles per hour.
So you should be able
to get from, say, Westwood to LAX
in six minutes  five, six minutes.




 2:12


(Applause)




 2:16


CA: So possibly, initially done,
it's like on a sort
of toll road-type basis.




 2:20


EM: Yeah.




 2:21


CA: Which, I guess,
alleviates some traffic
from the surface streets as well.




 2:25


EM: So, I don't know
if people noticed it in the video,
but there's no real limit
to how many levels of tunnel you can have.
You can go much further deep
than you can go up.
The deepest mines are much deeper
than the tallest buildings are tall,
so you can alleviate any arbitrary
level of urban congestion
with a 3D tunnel network.
This is a very important point.
So a key rebuttal to the tunnels
is that if you add one layer of tunnels,
that will simply alleviate congestion,
it will get used up,
and then you'll be back where you started,
back with congestion.
But you can go to any
arbitrary number of tunnels,
any number of levels.




 3:04


CA: But people  seen traditionally,
it's incredibly expensive to dig,
and that would block this idea.




 3:10


EM: Yeah.
Well, they're right.
To give you an example,
the LA subway extension,
which is  I think it's
a two-and-a-half mile extension
that was just completed
for two billion dollars.
So it's roughly a billion dollars a mile
to do the subway extension in LA.
And this is not the highest
utility subway in the world.
So yeah, it's quite difficult
to dig tunnels normally.
I think we need to have
at least a tenfold improvement
in the cost per mile of tunneling.




 3:43


CA: And how could you achieve that?




 3:47


EM: Actually, if you just do two things,
you can get to approximately
an order of magnitude improvement,
and I think you can go beyond that.
So the first thing to do
is to cut the tunnel diameter
by a factor of two or more.
So a single road lane tunnel
according to regulations
has to be 26 feet,
maybe 28 feet in diameter
to allow for crashes
and emergency vehicles
and sufficient ventilation
for combustion engine cars.
But if you shrink that diameter
to what we're attempting,
which is 12 feet, which is plenty
to get an electric skate through,
you drop the diameter by a factor of two
and the cross-sectional area
by a factor of four,
and the tunneling cost scales
with the cross-sectional area.
So that's roughly a half-order
of magnitude improvement right there.
Then tunneling machines currently tunnel
for half the time, then they stop,
and then the rest of the time
is putting in reinforcements
for the tunnel wall.
So if you design the machine instead
to do continuous
tunneling and reinforcing,
that will give you
a factor of two improvement.
Combine that and that's a factor of eight.
Also these machines are far from being
at their power or thermal limits,
so you can jack up the power
to the machine substantially.
I think you can get
at least a factor of two,
maybe a factor of four or five
improvement on top of that.
So I think there's a fairly
straightforward series of steps
to get somewhere in excess
of an order of magnitude improvement
in the cost per mile,
and our target actually is 
we've got a pet snail called Gary,
this is from Gary the snail
from ""South Park,""
I mean, sorry, ""SpongeBob SquarePants.""




 5:28


(Laughter)




 5:30


So Gary is capable of 
currently he's capable
of going 14 times faster
than a tunnel-boring machine.




 5:40


(Laughter)




 5:43


CA: You want to beat Gary.




 5:45


EM: We want to beat Gary.




 5:46


(Laughter)




 5:48


He's not a patient little fellow,
and that will be victory.
Victory is beating the snail.




 5:56


CA: But a lot of people imagining,
dreaming about future cities,
they imagine that actually
the solution is flying cars, drones, etc.
You go aboveground.
Why isn't that a better solution?
You save all that tunneling cost.




 6:09


EM: Right. I'm in favor of flying things.
Obviously, I do rockets,
so I like things that fly.
This is not some inherent bias
against flying things,
but there is a challenge with flying cars
in that they'll be quite noisy,
the wind force generated
will be very high.
Let's just say that if something's
flying over your head,
a whole bunch of flying cars
going all over the place,
that is not an anxiety-reducing situation.




 6:42


(Laughter)




 6:44


You don't think to yourself,
""Well, I feel better about today.""
You're thinking,
""Did they service their hubcap,
or is it going to come off
and guillotine me?""
Things like that.




 6:59


CA: So you've got this vision
of future cities with these rich,
3D networks of tunnels underneath.
Is there a tie-in here with Hyperloop?
Could you apply these tunnels
to use for this Hyperloop idea
you released a few years ago.




 7:13


EM: Yeah, so we've been
sort of puttering around
with the Hyperloop stuff for a while.
We built a Hyperloop test track
adjacent to SpaceX,
just for a student competition,
to encourage innovative
ideas in transport.
And it actually ends up being
the biggest vacuum chamber in the world
after the Large Hadron Collider,
by volume.
So it was quite fun to do that,
but it was kind of a hobby thing,
and then we think we might 
so we've built a little pusher car
to push the student pods,
but we're going to try seeing
how fast we can make the pusher go
if it's not pushing something.
So we're cautiously optimistic
we'll be able to be faster
than the world's fastest bullet train
even in a .8-mile stretch.




 8:11


CA: Whoa. Good brakes.




 8:13


EM: Yeah, I mean, it's  yeah.
It's either going to smash
into tiny pieces or go quite fast.




 8:20


CA: But you can picture,
then, a Hyperloop in a tunnel
running quite long distances.




 8:26


EM: Exactly.
And looking at tunneling technology,
it turns out that
in order to make a tunnel,
you have to 
In order to seal against the water table,
you've got to typically design
a tunnel wall to be good
to about five or six atmospheres.
So to go to vacuum is only one atmosphere,
or near-vacuum.
So actually, it sort of turns out
that automatically,
if you build a tunnel that is good enough
to resist the water table,
it is automatically
capable of holding vacuum.




 9:01


CA: Huh.




 9:03


EM: So, yeah.




 9:04


CA: And so you could actually picture,
what kind of length tunnel
is in Elon's future to running Hyperloop?




 9:12


EM: I think there's no real length limit.
You could dig as much as you want.
I think if you were to do something
like a DC-to-New York Hyperloop,
I think you'd probably want
to go underground the entire way
because it's a high-density area.
You're going under
a lot of buildings and houses,
and if you go deep enough,
you cannot detect the tunnel.
Sometimes people think,
well, it's going to be pretty annoying
to have a tunnel dug under my house.
Like, if that tunnel is dug
more than about three or four
tunnel diameters beneath your house,
you will not be able
to detect it being dug at all.
In fact, if you're able
to detect the tunnel being dug,
whatever device you are using,
you can get a lot of money
for that device from the Israeli military,
who is trying to detect
tunnels from Hamas,
and from the US Customs and Border patrol
that try and detect drug tunnels.
So the reality is
that earth is incredibly good
at absorbing vibrations,
and once the tunnel depth
is below a certain level,
it is undetectable.
Maybe if you have a very sensitive
seismic instrument,
you might be able to detect it.




10:28


CA: So you've started
a new company to do this
called The Boring Company.
Very nice. Very funny.




10:34


(Laughter)




10:35


EM: What's funny about that?




10:37


(Laughter)




10:39


CA: How much of your time is this?




10:42


EM: It's maybe ...
two or three percent.




10:48


CA: You've bought a hobby.
This is what an Elon Musk
hobby looks like.




10:52


(Laughter)




10:53


EM: I mean, it really is, like 
This is basically interns
and people doing it part time.
We bought some second-hand machinery.
It's kind of puttering along,
but it's making good progress, so 




11:11


CA: So an even bigger part of your time
is being spent on electrifying
cars and transport through Tesla.
Is one of the motivations
for the tunneling project
the realization that actually,
in a world where cars are electric
and where they're self-driving,
there may end up being
more cars on the roads
on any given hour than there are now?




11:33


EM: Yeah, exactly.
A lot of people think
that when you make cars autonomous,
they'll be able to go faster
and that will alleviate congestion.
And to some degree that will be true,
but once you have shared autonomy
where it's much cheaper to go by car
and you can go point to point,
the affordability of going in a car
will be better than that of a bus.
Like, it will cost less than a bus ticket.
So the amount of driving that will occur
will be much greater with shared autonomy,
and actually traffic will get far worse.




12:11


CA: You started Tesla
with the goal of persuading the world
that electrification
was the future of cars,
and a few years ago,
people were laughing at you.
Now, not so much.




12:23


EM: OK.




12:24


(Laughter)




12:26


I don't know. I don't know.




12:29


CA: But isn't it true that pretty much
every auto manufacturer
has announced
serious electrification plans
for the short- to medium-term future?




12:39


EM: Yeah. Yeah.
I think almost every automaker
has some electric vehicle program.
They vary in seriousness.
Some are very serious
about transitioning entirely to electric,
and some are just dabbling in it.
And some, amazingly,
are still pursuing fuel cells,
but I think that won't last much longer.




13:00


CA: But isn't there a sense, though, Elon,
where you can now just declare victory
and say, you know, ""We did it.""
Let the world electrify,
and you go on and focus on other stuff?




13:12


EM: Yeah.
I intend to stay with Tesla
as far into the future as I can imagine,
and there are a lot of exciting
things that we have coming.
Obviously the Model 3 is coming soon.
We'll be unveiling the Tesla Semi truck.




13:31


CA: OK, we're going to come to this.
So Model 3, it's supposed
to be coming in July-ish.




13:38


EM: Yeah, it's looking quite good
for starting production in July.




13:42


CA: Wow.
One of the things
that people are so excited about
is the fact that it's got autopilot.
And you put out this video a while back
showing what that technology
would look like.




13:57


EM: Yeah.
There's obviously autopilot
in Model S right now.
What are we seeing here?




14:02


EM: Yeah, so this is using
only cameras and GPS.
So there's no LIDAR
or radar being used here.
This is just using passive optical,
which is essentially what a person uses.
The whole road system
is meant to be navigated
with passive optical, or cameras,
and so once you solve cameras
or vision,
then autonomy is solved.
If you don't solve vision,
it's not solved.
So that's why our focus is
so heavily on having a vision neural net
that's very effective for road conditions.




14:42


CA: Right. Many other people
are going the LIDAR route.
You want cameras plus radar is most of it.




14:47


EM: You can absolutely
be superhuman with just cameras.
Like, you can probably do it
ten times better than humans would,
just cameras.




14:55


CA: So the new cars being sold right now
have eight cameras in them.
They can't yet do what that showed.
When will they be able to?




15:07


EM: I think we're still on track
for being able to go cross-country
from LA to New York by the end
of the year, fully autonomous.




15:17


CA: OK, so by the end
of the year, you're saying,
someone's going to sit in a Tesla
without touching the steering wheel,
tap in ""New York,"" off it goes.




15:27


EM: Yeah.




15:28


CA: Won't ever have to touch the wheel 
by the end of 2017.




15:33


EM: Yeah. Essentially,
November or December of this year,
we should be able to go all the way
from a parking lot in California
to a parking lot in New York,
no controls touched at any point
during the entire journey.




15:47


(Applause)




15:49


CA: Amazing.
But part of that is possible
because you've already got a fleet
of Teslas driving all these roads.
You're accumulating a huge amount
of data of that national road system.




16:02


EM: Yes, but the thing
that will be interesting
is that I'm actually fairly confident
it will be able to do that route
even if you change the route dynamically.
So, it's fairly easy 
If you say I'm going to be really good
at one specific route, that's one thing,
but it should be able to go,
really be very good,
certainly once you enter a highway,
to go anywhere on the highway system
in a given country.
So it's not sort of limited
to LA to New York.
We could change it
and make it Seattle-Florida,
that day, in real time.
So you were going from LA to New York.
Now go from LA to Toronto.




16:49


CA: So leaving aside
regulation for a second,
in terms of the technology alone,
the time when someone
will be able to buy one of your cars
and literally just take the hands
off the wheel and go to sleep
and wake up and find that they've arrived,
how far away is that, to do that safely?




17:06


EM: I think that's about two years.
So the real trick of it
is not how do you make it work
say 99.9 percent of the time,
because, like, if a car crashes
one in a thousand times,
then you're probably still not going
to be comfortable falling asleep.
You shouldn't be, certainly.




17:28


(Laughter)




17:31


It's never going to be perfect.
No system is going to be perfect,
but if you say it's perhaps 
the car is unlikely to crash
in a hundred lifetimes,
or a thousand lifetimes,
then people are like, OK, wow,
if I were to live a thousand lives,
I would still most likely
never experience a crash,
then that's probably OK.




17:53


CA: To sleep.
I guess the big concern of yours
is that people may actually
get seduced too early
to think that this is safe,
and that you'll have some horrible
incident happen that puts things back.




18:04


EM: Well, I think that the autonomy system
is likely to at least mitigate the crash,
except in rare circumstances.
The thing to appreciate
about vehicle safety
is this is probabilistic.
I mean, there's some chance that any time
a human driver gets in a car,
that they will have an accident
that is their fault.
It's never zero.
So really the key threshold for autonomy
is how much better does autonomy
need to be than a person
before you can rely on it?




18:38


CA: But once you get
literally safe hands-off driving,
the power to disrupt
the whole industry seems massive,
because at that point you've spoken
of people being able to buy a car,
drops you off at work,
and then you let it go
and provide a sort of Uber-like
service to other people,
earn you money,
maybe even cover the cost
of your lease of that car,
so you can kind of get a car for free.
Is that really likely?




19:02


EM: Yeah. Absolutely
this is what will happen.
So there will be a shared autonomy fleet
where you buy your car
and you can choose
to use that car exclusively,
you could choose to have it be used
only by friends and family,
only by other drivers
who are rated five star,
you can choose to share it sometimes
but not other times.
That's 100 percent what will occur.
It's just a question of when.




19:32


CA: Wow.
So you mentioned the Semi
and I think you're planning
to announce this in September,
but I'm curious whether there's
anything you could show us today?




19:42


EM: I will show you
a teaser shot of the truck.




19:46


(Laughter)




19:48


It's alive.




19:50


CA: OK.




19:51


EM: That's definitely a case
where we want to be cautious
about the autonomy features.
Yeah.




19:58


(Laughter)




20:00


CA: We can't see that much of it,
but it doesn't look like
just a little friendly neighborhood truck.
It looks kind of badass.
What sort of semi is this?




20:10


EM: So this is a heavy duty,
long-range semitruck.
So it's the highest weight capability
and with long range.
So essentially it's meant to alleviate
the heavy-duty trucking loads.
And this is something which
people do not today think is possible.
They think the truck doesn't have enough
power or it doesn't have enough range,
and then with the Tesla Semi
we want to show that no, an electric truck
actually can out-torque any diesel semi.
And if you had a tug-of-war competition,
the Tesla Semi
will tug the diesel semi uphill.




20:57


(Laughter)




21:00


(Applause)




21:02


CA: That's pretty cool.
And short term, these aren't driverless.
These are going to be trucks
that truck drivers want to drive.




21:09


EM: Yes. So what will be
really fun about this
is you have a flat torque RPM curve
with an electric motor,
whereas with a diesel motor or any kind
of internal combustion engine car,
you've got a torque RPM curve
that looks like a hill.
So this will be a very spry truck.
You can drive this
around like a sports car.
There's no gears.
It's, like, single speed.




21:33


CA: There's a great movie
to be made here somewhere.
I don't know what it is
and I don't know that it ends well,
but it's a great movie.




21:39


(Laughter)




21:40


EM: It's quite bizarre test-driving.
When I was driving the test prototype
for the first truck.
It's really weird,
because you're driving around
and you're just so nimble,
and you're in this giant truck.




21:52


CA: Wait, you've
already driven a prototype?




21:56


EM: Yeah, I drove it
around the parking lot,
and I was like, this is crazy.




21:59


CA: Wow. This is no vaporware.




22:02


EM: It's just like,
driving this giant truck
and making these mad maneuvers.




22:06


CA: This is cool.
OK, from a really badass picture
to a kind of less badass picture.
This is just a cute house
from ""Desperate Housewives"" or something.
What on earth is going on here?




22:17


EM: Well, this illustrates
the picture of the future
that I think is how things will evolve.
You've got an electric car
in the driveway.
If you look in between
the electric car and the house,
there are actually three Powerwalls
stacked up against the side of the house,
and then that house roof is a solar roof.
So that's an actual solar glass roof.




22:38


CA: OK.




22:39


EM: That's a picture of a real 
well, admittedly, it's a real fake house.
That's a real fake house.




22:45


(Laughter)




22:48


CA: So these roof tiles,
some of them have in them
basically solar power, the ability to 




22:56


EM: Yeah. Solar glass tiles
where you can adjust
the texture and the color
to a very fine-grained level,
and then there's
sort of microlouvers in the glass,
such that when you're looking
at the roof from street level
or close to street level,
all the tiles look the same
whether there is a solar cell
behind it or not.
So you have an even color
from the ground level.
If you were to look at it
from a helicopter,
you would be actually able
to look through and see
that some of the glass tiles have
a solar cell behind them and some do not.
You can't tell from street level.




23:42


CA: You put them in the ones
that are likely to see a lot of sun,
and that makes these roofs
super affordable, right?
They're not that much more expensive
than just tiling the roof.




23:50


EM: Yeah.
We're very confident
that the cost of the roof
plus the cost of electricity 
A solar glass roof will be less
than the cost of a normal roof
plus the cost of electricity.
So in other words,
this will be economically a no-brainer,
we think it will look great,
and it will last 
We thought about having
the warranty be infinity,
but then people thought,
well, that might sound
like were just talking rubbish,
but actually this is toughened glass.
Well after the house has collapsed
and there's nothing there,
the glass tiles will still be there.




24:35


(Applause)




24:37


CA: I mean, this is cool.
So you're rolling this out
in a couple week's time, I think,
with four different roofing types.




24:44


EM: Yeah, we're starting off
with two, two initially,
and the second two
will be introduced early next year.




24:50


CA: And what's the scale of ambition here?
How many houses do you believe
could end up having this type of roofing?




24:58


EM: I think eventually
almost all houses will have a solar roof.
The thing is to consider
the time scale here
to be probably on the order
of 40 or 50 years.
So on average, a roof
is replaced every 20 to 25 years.
But you don't start replacing
all roofs immediately.
But eventually,
if you say were to fast-forward
to say 15 years from now,
it will be unusual to have a roof
that does not have solar.




25:36


CA: Is there a mental model thing
that people don't get here
that because of the shift in the cost,
the economics of solar power,
most houses actually have
enough sunlight on their roof
pretty much to power all of their needs.
If you could capture the power,
it could pretty much
power all their needs.
You could go off-grid, kind of.




25:55


EM: It depends on where you are
and what the house size is
relative to the roof area,
but it's a fair statement to say
that most houses in the US
have enough roof area
to power all the needs of the house.




26:10


CA: So the key to the economics
of the cars, the Semi, of these houses
is the falling price
of lithium-ion batteries,
which you've made a huge bet on as Tesla.
In many ways, that's almost
the core competency.
And you've decided
that to really, like, own that competency,
you just have to build
the world's largest manufacturing plant
to double the world's supply
of lithium-ion batteries,
with this guy. What is this?




26:43


EM: Yeah, so that's the Gigafactory,
progress so far on the Gigafactory.
Eventually, you can sort of roughly see
that there's sort of
a diamond shape overall,
and when it's fully done,
it'll look like a giant diamond,
or that's the idea behind it,
and it's aligned on true north.
It's a small detail.




27:04


CA: And capable of producing, eventually,
like a hundred gigawatt hours
of batteries a year.




27:11


EM: A hundred gigawatt hours.
We think probably more, but yeah.




27:14


CA: And they're actually
being produced right now.




27:17


EM: They're in production already.
CA: You guys put out this video.
I mean, is that speeded up?




27:21


EM: That's the slowed down version.




27:23


(Laughter)




27:25


CA: How fast does it actually go?




27:27


EM: Well, when it's running at full speed,
you can't actually see the cells
without a strobe light.
It's just blur.




27:35


(Laughter)




27:39


CA: One of your core ideas, Elon,
about what makes an exciting future
is a future where we no longer
feel guilty about energy.
Help us picture this.
How many Gigafactories, if you like,
does it take to get us there?




27:52


EM: It's about a hundred, roughly.
It's not 10, it's not a thousand.
Most likely a hundred.




27:59


CA: See, I find this amazing.
You can picture what it would take
to move the world
off this vast fossil fuel thing.
It's like you're building one,
it costs five billion dollars,
or whatever, five to 10 billion dollars.
Like, it's kind of cool
that you can picture that project.
And you're planning to do, at Tesla 
announce another two this year.




28:24


EM: I think we'll announce locations
for somewhere between two
and four Gigafactories later this year.
Yeah, probably four.




28:33


CA: Whoa.




28:34


(Applause)
No more teasing from you for here?
Like  where, continent?
You can say no.




28:48


EM: We need to address a global market.




28:52


CA: OK.




28:53


(Laughter)




28:54


This is cool.
I think we should talk for 
Actually, double mark it.
I'm going to ask you one question
about politics, only one.
I'm kind of sick of politics,
but I do want to ask you this.
You're on a body now
giving advice to a guy 




29:18


EM: Who?




29:20


CA: Who has said he doesn't
really believe in climate change,
and there's a lot of people out there
who think you shouldn't be doing that.
They'd like you to walk away from that.
What would you say to them?




29:31


EM: Well, I think that first of all,
I'm just on two advisory councils
where the format consists
of going around the room
and asking people's opinion on things,
and so there's like a meeting
every month or two.
That's the sum total of my contribution.
But I think to the degree
that there are people in the room
who are arguing in favor
of doing something about climate change,
or social issues,
I've used the meetings I've had thus far
to argue in favor of immigration
and in favor of climate change.




30:13


(Applause)




30:15


And if I hadn't done that,
that wasn't on the agenda before.
So maybe nothing will happen,
but at least the words were said.




30:25


CA: OK.




30:26


(Applause)




30:30


So let's talk SpaceX and Mars.
Last time you were here,
you spoke about what seemed like
a kind of incredibly ambitious dream
to develop rockets
that were actually reusable.
And you've only gone and done it.




30:46


EM: Finally. It took a long time.




30:47


CA: Talk us through this.
What are we looking at here?




30:50


EM: So this is one of our rocket boosters
coming back from
very high and fast in space.
So just delivered the upper stage
at high velocity.
I think this might have been
at sort of Mach 7 or so,
delivery of the upper stage.




31:09


(Applause)




31:12


CA: So that was a sped-up 




31:14


EM: That was the slowed down version.




31:16


(Laughter)




31:17


CA: I thought that was
the sped-up version.
But I mean, that's amazing,
and several of these failed
before you finally
figured out how to do it,
but now you've done this,
what, five or six times?




31:28


EM: We're at eight or nine.




31:31


CA: And for the first time,
you've actually reflown
one of the rockets that landed.




31:35


EM: Yeah, so we landed the rocket booster
and then prepped it for flight again
and flew it again,
so it's the first reflight
of an orbital booster
where that reflight is relevant.
So it's important to appreciate
that reusability is only relevant
if it is rapid and complete.
So like an aircraft or a car,
the reusability is rapid and complete.
You do not send your aircraft
to Boeing in-between flights.




32:07


CA: Right. So this is allowing you
to dream of this really ambitious idea
of sending many, many, many people to Mars
in, what, 10 or 20 years time, I guess.




32:17


EM: Yeah.




32:19


CA: And you've designed
this outrageous rocket to do it.
Help us understand
the scale of this thing.




32:24


EM: Well, visually
you can see that's a person.
Yeah, and that's the vehicle.




32:33


(Laughter)




32:35


CA: So if that was a skyscraper,
that's like, did I read that,
a 40-story skyscraper?




32:40


EM: Probably a little more, yeah.
The thrust level of this is really 
This configuration is about four times
the thrust of the Saturn V moon rocket.




32:55


CA: Four times the thrust of the biggest
rocket humanity ever created before.




33:00


EM: Yeah. Yeah.




33:03


CA: As one does.
EM: Yeah.




33:05


(Laughter)




33:08


In units of 747, a 747 is only about
a quarter of a million pounds of thrust,
so for every 10 million pounds of thrust,
there's 40 747s.
So this would be the thrust equivalent
of 120 747s, with all engines blazing.




33:25


CA: And so even with a machine
designed to escape Earth's gravity,
I think you told me last time
this thing could actually
take a fully loaded 747,
people, cargo, everything,
into orbit.




33:37


EM: Exactly. This can take
a fully loaded 747 with maximum fuel,
maximum passengers,
maximum cargo on the 747 
this can take it as cargo.




33:51


CA: So based on this,
you presented recently
this Interplanetary Transport System
which is visualized this way.
This is a scene you picture in, what,
30 years time? 20 years time?
People walking into this rocket.




34:08


EM: I'm hopeful it's sort of
an eight- to 10-year time frame.
Aspirationally, that's our target.
Our internal targets
are more aggressive, but I think 




34:18


(Laughter)




34:22


CA: OK.




34:23


EM: While vehicle seems quite large
and is large by comparison
with other rockets,
I think the future spacecraft
will make this look like a rowboat.
The future spaceships
will be truly enormous.




34:42


CA: Why, Elon?
Why do we need to build a city on Mars
with a million people
on it in your lifetime,
which I think is kind of
what you've said you'd love to do?




34:55


EM: I think it's important to have
a future that is inspiring and appealing.
I just think there have to be reasons
that you get up in the morning
and you want to live.
Like, why do you want to live?
What's the point? What inspires you?
What do you love about the future?
And if we're not out there,
if the future does not include
being out there among the stars
and being a multiplanet species,
I find that it's incredibly depressing
if that's not the future
that we're going to have.




35:26


(Applause)




35:31


CA: People want to position this
as an either or,
that there are so many desperate things
happening on the planet now
from climate to poverty
to, you know, you pick your issue.
And this feels like a distraction.
You shouldn't be thinking about this.
You should be solving what's here and now.
And to be fair, you've done
a fair old bit to actually do that
with your work on sustainable energy.
But why not just do that?




35:58


EM: I think there's 
I look at the future
from the standpoint of probabilities.
It's like a branching
stream of probabilities,
and there are actions that we can take
that affect those probabilities
or that accelerate one thing
or slow down another thing.
I may introduce something new
to the probability stream.
Sustainable energy
will happen no matter what.
If there was no Tesla,
if Tesla never existed,
it would have to happen out of necessity.
It's tautological.
If you don't have sustainable energy,
it means you have unsustainable energy.
Eventually you will run out,
and the laws of economics
will drive civilization
towards sustainable energy,
inevitably.
The fundamental value
of a company like Tesla
is the degree to which it accelerates
the advent of sustainable energy,
faster than it would otherwise occur.




37:04


So when I think, like,
what is the fundamental good
of a company like Tesla,
I would say, hopefully,
if it accelerated that by a decade,
potentially more than a decade,
that would be quite a good thing to occur.
That's what I consider to be
the fundamental
aspirational good of Tesla.




37:24


Then there's becoming a multiplanet
species and space-faring civilization.
This is not inevitable.
It's very important to appreciate
this is not inevitable.
The sustainable energy future
I think is largely inevitable,
but being a space-faring civilization
is definitely not inevitable.
If you look at the progress in space,
in 1969 you were able
to send somebody to the moon.
1969.
Then we had the Space Shuttle.
The Space Shuttle could only
take people to low Earth orbit.
Then the Space Shuttle retired,

Getting a college education
is a 20-year investment.
When you're growing up poor,
you're not accustomed
to thinking that far ahead.
Instead, you're thinking about
where you're going to get your next meal
and how your family
is going to pay rent that month.
Besides, my parents
and my friends' parents
seemed to be doing just fine
driving taxis and working as janitors.
It wasn't until I was a teenager
when I realized I didn't
want to do those things.
By then, I was two-thirds of the way
through my education,
and it was almost too late
to turn things around.




 0:48


When you grow up poor,
you want to be rich.
I was no different.
I'm the second-oldest of seven,
and was raised by a single mother
on government aid
in Queens, New York.
By virtue of growing up low-income,
my siblings and I went
to some of New York City's
most struggling public schools.
I had over 60 absences
when I was in seventh grade,
because I didn't feel like going to class.
My high school had
a 55 percent graduation rate,
and even worse,
only 20 percent of the kids graduating
were college-ready.




 1:21


When I actually did make it to college,
I told my friend Brennan
how our teachers would always ask us
to raise our hands
if we were going to college.
I was taken aback when Brennan said,
""Karim, I've never been asked
that question before.""
It was always, ""What college
are you going to?""
Just the way that question is phrased
made it unacceptable for him
not to have gone to college.




 1:46


Nowadays I get asked a different question.
""How were you able to make it out?""
For years I said I was lucky,
but it's not just luck.
When my older brother and I
graduated from high school
at the very same time
and he later dropped out
of a two-year college,
I wanted to understand why he dropped out
and I kept studying.
It wasn't until I got to Cornell
as a Presidential Research Scholar
that I started to learn about
the very real educational consequences
of being raised by a single mother
on government aid
and attending the schools that I did.
That's when my older brother's trajectory
began to make complete sense to me.




 2:27


I also learned that our most admirable
education reformers,
people like Arne Duncan,
the former US Secretary of Education,
or Wendy Kopp, the founder
of Teach For America,
had never attended an inner city
public school like I had.
So much of our education reform
is driven by a sympathetic approach,
where people are saying,
""Let's go and help
these poor inner city kids,
or these poor black and Latino kids,""
instead of an empathetic approach,
where someone like me, who had grown up
in this environment, could say,
""I know the adversities that you're facing
and I want to help you overcome them.""




 3:02


Today when I get questions
about how I made it out,
I share that one of the biggest reasons
is that I wasn't ashamed to ask for help.
In a typical middle class
or affluent household,
if a kid is struggling,
there's a good chance that a parent
or a teacher will come to their rescue
even if they don't ask for help.
However, if that same kid
is growing up poor
and doesn't ask for help,
there's a good chance
that no one will help them.
There are virtually
no social safety nets available.




 3:32


So seven years ago,
I started to reform
our public education system
shaped by my firsthand perspective.
And I started with summer school.
Research tells us that two-thirds
of the achievement gap,
which is the disparity
in educational attainment
between rich kids and poor kids
or black kids and white kids,
could be directly attributed
to the summer learning loss.
In low-income neighborhoods,
kids forget almost three months
of what they learned
during the school year
over the summer.
They return to school in the fall,
and their teachers
spend another two months
reteaching them old material.
That's five months.
The school year in the United States
is only 10 months.
If kids lose five months of learning
every single year,
that's half of their education.
Half.




 4:19


If kids were in school over the summer,
then they couldn't regress,
but traditional summer school
is poorly designed.
For kids it feels like punishment,
and for teachers
it feels like babysitting.
But how can we expect principals
to execute an effective summer program
when the school year
ends the last week of June
and then summer school starts
just one week later?
There just isn't enough time
to find the right people,
sort out the logistics,
and design an engaging curriculum
that excites kids and teachers.




 4:50


But what if we created a program
over the summer
that empowered teachers
as teaching coaches
to develop aspiring educators?
What if we empowered
college-educated role models
as teaching fellows
to help kids realize
their college ambitions?
What if empowered high-achieving kids
as mentors to tutor their younger peers
and inspire them
to invest in their education?
What if we empowered all kids as scholars,
asked them what colleges
they were going to,
designed a summer school
they want to attend
to completely eliminate
the summer learning loss
and close two-thirds
of the achievement gap?




 5:36


By this summer, my team will have served
over 4,000 low-income children,
trained over 300 aspiring teachers
and created more than 1,000 seasonal jobs
across some of New York City's
most disadvantaged neighborhoods.




 5:50


(Applause)




 5:55


And our kids are succeeding.
Two years of independent evaluations
tell us that our kids
eliminate the summer learning loss
and make growth of one month in math
and two months in reading.
So instead of returning to school
in the fall three months behind,
they now go back four months ahead in math
and five months ahead in reading.




 6:16


(Applause)




 6:23


Ten years ago, if you would have told me
that I'd graduate in the top 10 percent
of my class from an Ivy League institution
and have an opportunity to make a dent
on our public education system
just by tackling two months
of the calendar year,
I would have said,
""Nah. No way.""
What's even more exciting
is that if we can prevent
five months of lost time
just by redesigning two months,
imagine the possibilities
that we can unlock
by tackling the rest of the calendar year.




 6:57


Thank you.

I'm going to tell you the story of a song.
I was in Madrid one night in 2002
with my teacher and friend Joaqun Sabina,
when he said he had something to give me.
He said,
""Jorge, I have some lines
that you need to put into a song.
Take these down, take these down.""
I looked on the table but all I found
was a circular coaster,
on which I wrote the lines
my teacher dictated.
They were four lines that went like this:




 0:38


""I am a Jewish Moor
living among Christians
I don't know who my God is,
nor who my brothers are.""




 0:47


Those lines really made
an impression on me.
I said, ""What beautiful lyrics,
Joaqun. Did you write them?""
He said no, they were by another composer
named Chicho Snchez Ferlosio,
who was less known than Joaqun,
but also a great poet.
These lines came to me at a time
where I had been wanting
to express something for a while,
but didn't quite know how.




 1:08


I was getting up to leave
and go home to write,
when Joaqun stopped me
and said, ""Hang on, hang on,""
and presented me with this challenge:
""Write the stanzas for this song
in Dcimas.""
Now, at this point in my life,
I still wasn't completely
sure what Dcimas were,
but I was too embarrassed
to tell my teacher I didn't know.
So I put on my best
""Yeah, I totally understand"" face,
and went home to look up
what Dcimas were.
I learned that a Dcima is a type of verse
that only exists in Spanish,
and that it has 10 lines.
It's very, very complex 
perhaps the most complex style of stanza
that we have in Spanish.
It also has a very concrete
date of origin,
which is very rare for a style of stanza.




 1:55


The Dcima was invented in Spain in 1591,
by a guy named Vicente Espinel,
a musician and poet from Mlaga.
And listen to this coincidence:
he was the same guy
who added the sixth string
to what would later be called
the Spanish guitar.
This string right here 
it's called the ""bordona.""




 2:17


From Spain, the Dcima, with its 10 lines,
crosses over to America,
just like the Spanish guitar,
but in contrast to the Dcima,
the Spanish guitar continues to live today
on both sides of the Atlantic.
But the Dcima, in Spain, its birthplace,
disappeared; it died out.
It died out about 200 years ago,
and yet in Latin America,
from Mexico to Chile,
all our countries maintain
some form of the Dcima
in our popular traditions.




 2:51


In each place, they've given it
a different name,
and set it to different music.
It has a lot of different names 
more than 20 in total on the continent.
In Mexico, for example,
it's called the ""Son Jarocho,""
""Canto de mejorana"" in Panama;
""Galern"" in Venezuela;
""Payada"" in Uruguay and Argentina;
""Repentismo"" in Cuba.
In Peru, they call it the Peruvian Dcima,
because the Dcima becomes
so integrated into our traditions,
that if someone asks, people
from each place are completely convinced
that the Dcima was invented
in their country.




 3:23


(Laughter)




 3:24


It's also got a really surprising feature,
which is that despite the fact
that it developed independently
in each of the different countries,
it maintains even today,
400 years after its creation,
exactly the same rhyme,
syllable and line structure 
the same structure Vicente Espinel gave it
during the Spanish Baroque period.
Here's the structure 
I'll give you the basic idea
and then later you can look online
and learn more about it.




 3:54


The Dcima is ten lines long;
each line has eight syllables.
The first line rhymes
with the fourth and the fifth;
the second line, with the third;
the sixth line,
with the seventh and the tenth;
and the eighth line rhymes with the ninth.
It's a bit complicated, to be honest.
And me  imagine me,
trying to write in Dcimas.
But it's not as complicated as it seems.
Plus, it's amazing that it's survived
with the same structure
for more than four centuries.
It's not that complicated, because it has
an impressive musicality to it,
a type of musicality
that's very hard to describe technically.
I prefer that you listen to it.
So I'm going to recite a Dcima,
one of the Dcimas
that I wrote for this song.
I'm going to ask that you concentrate
just on the musicality of the rhymes.
For those of you with headphones on 
I see that some of you are listening
to the translation 
please take them off for a minute.




 4:58


(English) Take your headphones off,
it you have them.




 5:02


(English) Forget about the meaning
of the words for a few seconds,




 5:08


(English) and then you'll put them back.




 5:10


(English) Forget about the structure.




 5:12


(Spanish) Forget about the structure.




 5:14


(English) And just ... it's all about
the choreography of sound of the Dcima.




 5:19


(Spanish) A choreography of sound.




 5:23


(Sings in Spanish) ""There is not one death
that does not cause me pain,
there are no winners,
heres nothing but suffering
and another life blown away.
War is a terrible school
no matter what the disguise,
forgive me for not enlisting
under any flag,
any daydream is worth more
than a sad piece of cloth.""




 5:45


That's a Dcima.




 5:47


(English) You can put
your headphones back on.




 5:49


(Applause)




 5:50


(English) Thank you.




 5:51


(Applause)




 5:56


I also applaud Vicente Espinel,
because here it is 426 years later,
and the Dcima lives on everywhere
in its original state.




 6:02


I wrote three like that one;
you just heard the second.
I wrote the first one having only
recently learned how,
and it has some errors in terms of meter,
so it's not presentable
in its current state.
But the one I sang was good, more or less.
So: What was it about?
What was the meaning behind those lines?




 6:20


I had just returned from doing
a concert in Israel,
and I was very emotional over a problem
that hits really close to home,
which is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
I'll explain: my dad's family is Jewish,
and my mom's family
are non-practicing Christians.
I was raised in a home
where the two traditions lived together
more or less in harmony.
It wasn't unusual to see my Jewish grandpa
dressed as Santa Claus, for example,
or to see my non-Jewish grandpa
at the synagogue wearing his kippah,
at family celebrations, wearing the same
expression that I probably had
when Sabina told me 




 6:55


(Laughter)




 6:56


that he had some Dcima lines for me.
For someone raised
in that kind of environment,
it's especially painful to see
the difficulty the opposing parties have
in putting themselves in the other
side's shoes even for a moment.
So that's what I wrote about.




 7:15


I already had the lyrics,
I had the form  the Dcima 
and the content.
I needed to write the music.
I'll give you some context.
I had only recently moved from Uruguay,
where I'm from, to Spain.
And I was feeling very raw with nostalgia,
like many of you here,
who are away from home.
And I wanted my song
to be very, very Uruguayan,
the most Uruguayan type of song
there is  the milonga.
So now, I had been studying the Dcima,
and after finding out
that everyone tried to claim
the Dcima as their own,
that it was invented in their country,
it made me wonder:
What does it mean when we say
the milonga is Uruguayan?




 7:57


The milonga has a rhythmic pattern
that we musicians call 3-3-2.




 8:03


(Counts out the beats) One two three,
one two three, one two.




 8:10


And it has a characteristic emphasis.




 8:13


(Sings)




 8:21


But this characteristic rhythm pattern
comes from Africa.
In the ninth century you could find it
in the brothels of Persia,
and in the thirteenth,
in Spain, from where,
five centuries later,
it would cross over to America
with the African slaves.
Meanwhile, in the Balkans,
it encounters the Roma scale 




 8:43


(Sings)




 8:50


which in part, gives birth
to klezmer music,
which Ukrainian Jewish immigrants
bring to Brooklyn, New York.
They sing it in their banquet halls.




 9:01


(Sings ""Hava Nagila"")




 9:08


And their neighbor,
an Argentine kid of Italian origin
named Astor Piazzolla,
hears it,
assimilates it
and transforms the tango
of the second half of the 20th century
with his ...




 9:21


(Counts out the beats) One two three,
one two three, one two.




 9:25


(Sings ""Adios Nonino"")




 9:33


He also played it on his bandoneon,
a 19th-century German instrument
created for churches
that weren't allowed to buy organs,
and that ends up, incredibly,
in Ro de la Plata,
forming the very essence
of the tango and the milonga,
in the very same way another instrument
just as important as the bandoneon did:
the Spanish guitar.




 9:55


(Applause)




10:07


To which, by the way,
Vicente Espinel, in the 16th century,
added a sixth string.
It's amazing how all these things
are coming full circle.




10:14


What have I learned in these 15 years
since the song was born
from going all over the world
with four lines written on a coaster
from a bar in Madrid?
That Dcimas,
the milonga,
songs, people 
the closer you get to them,
the more complex their identity becomes,
and the more nuances and details appear.
I learned that identity
is infinitely dense,
like an infinite series of real numbers,
and that even if you get very close
and zoom in,
it never ends.




10:49


Before I sing you a song and say goodbye,
allow me to tell you one last story.
Not long ago, we were in Mexico
after a concert.
And since the concert promoters know me,
they knew I was a Dcima freak
and that everywhere I go I ask about it,
insisting on hearing Dcima artists.
So they organized a son jarocho show
for me at their house.
If you recall, the son jarocho
is one of the styles of music
that uses Dcimas in its verses.




11:23


When these amazing musicians
finished playing
what is for me, something amazing,
which is the son jarocho,
they finished playing and were ...
I went up to greet them, really excited,
getting ready to thank them
for their gift of music,
and this young kid says to me 
and he says it with the best
of intentions  he says,
""We're very proud, sir, to be keeping
alive the purest origins
of our Mexican identity.""
And to tell you the truth,
I didn't really know what to say.




11:58


(Laughter)




11:59


I stood there looking at him.
I gave him a hug and left, but ...




12:02


(Laughter)




12:03


But he was right, too, though. Right?
In reality, the Dcima is its origin,
but at the same time,
just like in the milonga
and in the Dcima,
are the roots of many more cultures
from all over the place, like he said.




12:17


Later, when I got back to the hotel,
I thought about it for a while.
And I thought:
things only look pure
if you look at them from far away.
It's very important
to know about our roots,
to know where we come from,
to understand our history.
But at the same time, as important
as knowing where we're from,
is understanding that deep down,
we're all from nowhere
and a little bit from everywhere.




12:46


Thank you very much.




12:47


(Applause)




12:57


This is ""The milonga of the Jewish Moor.""




13:01

13:13

13:15


For every wall a lament
in Jerusalem the golden




13:23

worth more than a human life.

no matter what the disguise,

15:11


I don't know who my God is,

15:24


And nobody has my permission
for killing in my name,




15:32


a man is but a man
and if there is a God, this was his wish,




15:39


the very ground I tread
will live on, once I am gone




15:46


on my way to oblivion, and all doctrines
will suffer the same fate,




15:53


and there is not one nation
that has not proclaimed itself




15:58


the chosen people.




16:02


I am a Jewish Moor
who lives among Christians




16:09


I don't know who my God is,

Chris Anderson: So Robert
spent the last few years
think about how weird human behavior is,
and how inadequate most
of our language trying to explain it is.
And it's very exciting to hear him
explain some of the thinking behind it
in public for the first time.
Over to you now, Robert Sapolsky.




 0:29


(Applause)




 0:34


Robert Sapolsky: Thank you.
The fantasy always runs
something like this.
I've overpowered his elite guard,
burst into his secret bunker
with my machine gun ready.
He lunges for his Luger.
I knock it out of his hand.
He lunges for his cyanide pill.
I knock that out of his hand.
He snarls,
comes at me with otherworldly strength.
We grapple, we fight,
I manage to pin him down
and put on handcuffs.
""Adolf Hitler,"" I say,
""I arrest you for crimes
against humanity.""




 1:09


Here's where the Medal of Honor
version of the fantasy ends
and the imagery darkens.
What would I do if I had Hitler?
It's not hard to imagine
once I allow myself.
Sever his spine at the neck.
Take out his eyes with a blunt instrument.
Puncture his eardrums. Cut out his tongue.
Leave him alive on a respirator,
tube-fed, not able to speak
or move or see or hear, just to feel,
and then inject him
with something cancerous
that's going to fester and pustulate
until every cell in his body
is screaming in agony,
until every second
feels like an eternity in hell.
That's what I would do to Hitler.




 1:52


I've had this fantasy since I was a kid,
still do sometimes,
and when I do, my heart speeds up 
all these plans for the most evil,
wicked soul in history.
But there's a problem,
which is I don't actually believe
in souls or evil,
and I think wicked belongs in a musical.
But there's some people
I would like to see killed,
but I'm against the death penalty.
But I like schlocky violent movies,
but I'm for strict gun control.
But then there was a time
I was at a laser tag place,
and I had such a good time
hiding in a corner shooting at people.
In other words, I'm your basic
confused human when it comes to violence.




 2:32


Now, as a species, we obviously
have problems with violence.
We use shower heads to deliver poison gas,
letters with anthrax,
airplanes as weapons,
mass rape as a military strategy.
We're a miserably violent species.
But there's a complication,
which is we don't hate violence,
we hate the wrong kind.
And when it's the right kind,
we cheer it on, we hand out medals,
we vote for, we mate with
our champions of it.
When it's the right kind of violence,
we love it.
And there's another complication,
which is, in addition to us
being this miserably violent species,
we're also this extraordinarily
altruistic, compassionate one.




 3:14


So how do you make sense
of the biology of our best behaviors,
our worst ones and all of those
ambiguously in between?




 3:21


Now, for starters,
what's totally boring is understanding
the motoric aspects of the behavior.
Your brain tells your spine,
tells your muscles
to do something or other,
and hooray, you've behaved.
What's hard is understanding
the meaning of the behavior,
because in some settings,
pulling a trigger is an appalling act;
in others, it's heroically
self-sacrificial.
In some settings, putting your hand
one someone else's
is deeply compassionate.
In others, it's a deep betrayal.
The challenge is to understand
the biology of the context
of our behaviors,
and that's real tough.




 3:58


One thing that's clear, though,
is you're not going to get anywhere
if you think there's going to be
the brain region or the hormone
or the gene or the childhood experience
or the evolutionary mechanism
that explains everything.
Instead, every bit of behavior
has multiple levels of causality.




 4:17


Let's look at an example.
You have a gun.
There's a crisis going on:
rioting, violence, people running around.
A stranger is running at you
in an agitated state 
you can't quite tell if the expression
is frightened, threatening, angry 
holding something
that kind of looks like a handgun.
You're not sure.
The stranger comes running at you
and you pull the trigger.
And it turns out
that thing in this person's hand
was a cell phone.




 4:47


So we asked this biological question:
what was going on
that caused this behavior?
What caused this behavior?
And this is a multitude of questions.




 4:56


We start.
What was going on in your brain
one second before you pulled that trigger?
And this brings us into the realm
of a brain region called the amygdala.
The amygdala, which is
central to violence, central to fear,
initiates volleys of cascades
that produce pulling of a trigger.
What was the level of activity
in your amygdala one second before?




 5:19


But to understand that,
we have to step back a little bit.
What was going on in the environment
seconds to minutes before
that impacted the amygdala?
Now, obviously, the sights,
the sounds of the rioting,
that was pertinent.
But in addition,
you're more likely to mistake
a cell phone for a handgun
if that stranger was male
and large and of a different race.
Furthermore, if you're in pain,
if you're hungry, if you're exhausted,
your frontal cortex
is not going to work as well,
part of the brain whose job it is
to get to the amygdala in time
saying, ""Are you really sure
that's a gun there?""




 5:57


But we need to step further back.
Now we have to look
at hours to days before,
and with this, we have entered
the realm of hormones.
For example, testosterone,
where regardless of your sex,
if you have elevated
testosterone levels in your blood,
you're more likely to think
a face with a neutral expression
is instead looking threatening.
Elevated testosterone levels,
elevated levels of stress hormones,
and your amygdala
is going to be more active
and your frontal cortex
will be more sluggish.




 6:28


Pushing back further,
weeks to months before,
where's the relevance there?
This is the realm of neural plasticity,
the fact that your brain
can change in response to experience,
and if your previous months
have been filled with stress and trauma,
your amygdala will have enlarged.
The neurons will have become
more excitable,
your frontal cortex would have atrophied,
all relevant to what happens
in that one second.




 6:53


But we push back even more, back years,
back, for example, to your adolescence.
Now, the central fact
of the adolescent brain
is all of it is going full blast
except the frontal cortex,
which is still half-baked.
It doesn't fully mature
until you're around 25.
And thus, adolescence and early adulthood
are the years where environment
and experience sculpt your frontal cortex
into the version you're going to have
as an adult in that critical moment.




 7:23


But pushing back even further,
even further back
to childhood and fetal life
and all the different versions
that that could come in.
Now, obviously, that's the time
that your brain is being constructed,
and that's important,
but in addition,
experience during those times
produce what are called
epigenetic changes,
permanent, in some cases,
permanently activating
certain genes, turning off others.
And as an example of this,
if as a fetus you were exposed to a lot
of stress hormones through your mother,
epigenetics is going to produce
your amygdala in adulthood
as a more excitable form,
and you're going to have
elevated stress hormone levels.




 8:03


But pushing even further back,
back to when you were just a fetus,
back to when all you were
was a collection of genes.
Now, genes are really
important to all of this,
but critically, genes don't
determine anything,
because genes work differently
in different environments.
Key example here:
there's a variant of a gene called MAO-A,
and if you have that variant,
you are far more likely
to commit antisocial violence
if, and only if,
you were abused as a child.
Genes and environment interact,
and what's happening in that one second
before you pull that trigger
reflects your lifetime
of those gene-environment interactions.




 8:45


Now, remarkably enough,
we've got to push even further back now,
back centuries.
What were your ancestors up to.
And if, for example,
they were nomadic pastoralists,
they were pastoralists,
people living in deserts or grasslands
with their herds of camels, cows, goats,
odds are they would have invented
what's called a culture of honor
filled with warrior classes,
retributive violence, clan vendettas,
and amazingly, centuries later,
that would still be influencing
the values with which you were raised.




 9:18


But we've got to push even further back,
back millions of years,
because if we're talking about genes,
implicitly we're now talking
about the evolution of genes.
And what you see is, for example,
patterns across different primate species.
Some of them have evolved
for extremely low levels of aggression,
others have evolved
in the opposite direction,
and floating there in between
by every measure are humans,
once again this confused,
barely defined species
that has all these potentials
to go one way or the other.




 9:52


So what has this gotten us to?
Basically, what we're seeing here is,
if you want to understand a behavior,
whether it's an appalling one,
a wondrous one,
or confusedly in between,
if you want to understand that,
you've got take into account
what happened a second before
to a million years before,
everything in between.




10:11


So what can we conclude at this point?
Officially, it's complicated.
Wow, that's really helpful.
It's complicated,
and you'd better be
real careful, real cautious
before you conclude
you know what causes a behavior,
especially if it's a behavior
you're judging harshly.




10:29


Now, to me, the single most important
point about all of this
is one having to do with change.
Every bit of biology I have mentioned here
can change in different circumstances.
For example, ecosystems change.
Thousands of years ago,
the Sahara was a lush grassland.
Cultures change.
In the 17th century, the most terrifying
people in Europe were the Swedes,
rampaging all over the place.
This is what the Swedish
military does now.
They haven't had a war in 200 years.
Most importantly,
brains change.
Neurons grow new processes.
Circuits disconnect.
Everything in the brain changes,
and out of this come extraordinary
examples of human change.




11:16


First one:
this is a man named John Newton,
a British theologian
who played a central role in the abolition
of slavery from the British Empire
in the early 1800s.
And amazingly, this man
spent decades as a younger man
as the captain of a slave ship,
and then as an investor in slavery,
growing rich from this.
And then something changed.
Something changed in him,
something that Newton himself celebrated
in the thing that he's most famous for,
a hymn that he wrote:
""Amazing Grace.""




11:54


This is a man named Zenji Abe
on the morning of December 6, 1941,
about to lead a squadron of Japanese
bombers to attack Pearl Harbor.
And this is the same man
50 years later to the day
hugging a man who survived
the attack on the ground.
And as an old man,
Zenji Abe came to a collection
of Pearl Harbor survivors
at a ceremony there
and in halting English apologized
for what he had done as a young man.




12:23


Now, it doesn't always require decades.
Sometimes, extraordinary change
could happen in just hours.
Consider the World War I
Christmas truce of 1914.
The powers that be
had negotiated a brief truce
so that soldiers could go out,
collect bodies from no-man's-land
in between the trench lines.
And soon British and German soldiers
were doing that,
and then helping each other carry bodies,
and then helping each other
dig graves in the frozen ground,
and then praying together,
and then having Christmas together
and exchanging gifts,
and by the next day,
they were playing soccer together
and exchanging addresses
so they could meet after the war.
That truce kept going
until the officers had to arrive
and said, ""We will shoot you
unless you go back
to trying to kill each other.""
And all it took here was hours
for these men to develop
a completely new category of ""us,""
all of us in the trenches here
on both sides, dying for no damn reason,
and who is a ""them,""
those faceless powers behind the lines
who were using them as pawns.




13:29


And sometimes,
change can occur in seconds.
Probably the most horrifying event
in the Vietnam War
was the My Lai Massacre.
A brigade of American soldiers
went into an undefended
village full of civilians
and killed between 350 and 500 of them,
mass-raped women and children,
mutilated bodies.
It was appalling.
It was appalling because it occurred,
because the government denied it,
because the US government eventually
did nothing more than a slap on the wrist,
and appalling because it almost certainly
was not a singular event.
This man, Hugh Thompson, this is the man
who stopped the My Lai Massacre.
He was piloting a helicopter gunship,
landed there, got out
and saw American soldiers shooting babies,
shooting old women,
figured out what was going on,
and he then took his helicopter
and did something that undid
his lifetime of conditioning
as to who is an ""us"" and who is a ""them.""
He landed his helicopter
in between some surviving villagers
and American soldiers
and he trained his machine guns
on his fellow Americans,
and said, ""If you don't stop the killing,
I will mow you down.""




14:45


Now, these people
are no more special than any of us.
Same neurons, same neurochemicals,
same biology.
What we're left with here
is this inevitable cliche:
""Those who don't study history
are destined to repeat it.""
What we have here is the opposite of it.
Those who don't study the history
of extraordinary human change,
those who don't study the biology
of what can transform us
from our worst to our best behaviors,
those who don't do this
are destined not to be able
to repeat these incandescent,
magnificent moments.




15:19


So thank you.




15:21


(Applause)




15:31


CA: Talks that really give you
a new mental model about something,

Namaskar.




 0:16


I'm a movie star, I'm 51 years of age,
and I don't use Botox as yet.




 0:22


(Laughter)




 0:24


So I'm clean, but I do behave like you saw
like a 21-year-old in my movies.
Yeah, I do that.
I sell dreams, and I peddle love
to millions of people back home in India
who assume that I'm
the best lover in the world.




 0:37


(Laughter)




 0:41


If you don't tell anyone,
I'm going to tell you I'm not,
but I never let that assumption go away.




 0:45


(Laughter)




 0:46


I've also been made to understand
there are lots of you here
who haven't seen my work,
and I feel really sad for you.




 0:52


(Laughter)




 0:54


(Applause)




 0:59


That doesn't take away from the fact
that I'm completely self-obsessed,
as a movie star should be.




 1:04


(Laughter)




 1:05


That's when my friends,
Chris and Juliet called me here
to speak about the future ""you.""
Naturally, it follows I'm going
to speak about the present me.




 1:13


(Laughter)




 1:18


Because I truly believe
that humanity is a lot like me.




 1:21


(Laughter)




 1:22


It is. It is.
It's an aging movie star,
grappling with all
the newness around itself,
wondering whether
it got it right in the first place,
and still trying to find a way
to keep on shining regardless.




 1:36


I was born in a refugee colony
in the capital city of India, New Delhi.
And my father was a freedom fighter.
My mother was, well,
just a fighter like mothers are.
And much like the original homo sapiens,
we struggled to survive.
When I was in my early 20s,
I lost both my parents,
which I must admit
seems a bit careless of me now,
but 




 2:02


(Laughter)




 2:08


I do remember the night my father died,
and I remember the driver of a neighbor
who was driving us to the hospital.
He mumbled something
about ""dead people don't tip so well""
and walked away into the dark.
And I was only 14 then,
and I put my father's dead body
in the back seat of the car,
and my mother besides me,
I started driving back
from the hospital to the house.
And in the middle of her quiet crying,
my mother looked at me and she said,
""Son, when did you learn to drive?""
And I thought about it
and realized, and I said to my mom,
""Just now, Mom.""




 2:41


(Laughter)




 2:43


So from that night onwards,
much akin to humanity in its adolescence,
I learned the crude tools of survival.
And the framework of life was
very, very simple then, to be honest.
You know, you just ate what you got
and did whatever you were told to do.
I thought celiac was a vegetable,
and vegan, of course, was Mr. Spock's
lost comrade in ""Star Trek.""




 3:08


(Laughter)




 3:09


You married the first girl that you dated,
and you were a techie if you could fix
the carburetor in your car.
I really thought that gay was
a sophisticated English word for happy.
And Lesbian, of course, was the capital
of Portugal, as you all know.




 3:26


(Laughter)




 3:27


Where was I?
We relied on systems
created through the toil and sacrifice
of generations before
to protect us,
and we felt that governments
actually worked for our betterment.
Science was simple and logical,
Apple was still then just a fruit
owned by Eve first and then Newton,
not by Steve Jobs, until then.
And ""Eureka!"" was what you screamed
when you wanted
to run naked on the streets.
You went wherever life took you for work,
and people were mostly welcoming of you.
Migration was a term then
still reserved for Siberian cranes,
not human beings.
Most importantly, you were who you were
and you said what you thought.




 4:14


Then in my late 20s,
I shifted to the sprawling
metropolis of Mumbai,
and my framework,
like the newly industrialized
aspirational humanity,
began to alter.
In the urban rush for a new,
more embellished survival,
things started to look a little different.
I met people who had descended
from all over the world,
faces, races, genders, money-lenders.
Definitions became more and more fluid.
Work began to define you at that time
in an overwhelmingly equalizing manner,
and all the systems
started to feel less reliable to me,
almost too thick to hold on
to the diversity of mankind
and the human need to progress and grow.
Ideas were flowing
with more freedom and speed.
And I experienced the miracle
of human innovation and cooperation,
and my own creativity,
when supported by the resourcefulness
of this collective endeavor,
catapulted me into superstardom.




 5:16


I started to feel that I had arrived,
and generally, by the time I was 40,
I was really, really flying.
I was all over the place.
You know? I'd done 50 films by then
and 200 songs,
and I'd been knighted by the Malaysians.
I had been given the highest civil honor
by the French government,
the title of which for the life of me
I can't pronounce even until now.




 5:36


(Laughter)




 5:37


I'm sorry, France, and thank you,
France, for doing that.
But much bigger than that,
I got to meet Angelina Jolie 




 5:44


(Laughter)




 5:47


for two and a half seconds.




 5:48


(Laughter)




 5:50


And I'm sure she also remembers
that encounter somewhere.
OK, maybe not.
And I sat next to Hannah Montana
on a round dinner table
with her back towards me most of the time.
Like I said, I was flying,
from Miley to Jolie,
and humanity was soaring with me.
We were both pretty much
flying off the handle, actually.




 6:10


And then you all know what happened.
The internet happened.
I was in my late 40s,
and I started tweeting
like a canary in a birdcage
and assuming that, you know,
people who peered into my world
would admire it
for the miracle I believed it to be.
But something else
awaited me and humanity.
You know, we had expected
an expansion of ideas and dreams
with the enhanced
connectivity of the world.
We had not bargained
for the village-like enclosure of thought,
of judgment, of definition
that flowed from the same place
that freedom and revolution
was taking place in.
Everything I said took a new meaning.
Everything I did  good, bad, ugly 
was there for the world
to comment upon and judge.
As a matter of fact,
everything I didn't say or do also
met with the same fate.




 7:07


Four years ago,
my lovely wife Gauri and me
decided to have a third child.
It was claimed on the net
that he was the love child
of our first child
who was 15 years old.
Apparently, he had sown
his wild oats with a girl
while driving her car in Romania.
And yeah, there was
a fake video to go with it.
And we were so disturbed as a family.
My son, who is 19 now,
even now when you say ""hello"" to him,
he just turns around and says,
""But bro, I didn't even have
a European driving license.""




 7:41


(Laughter)




 7:44


Yeah.
In this new world,
slowly, reality became virtual
and virtual became real,
and I started to feel
that I could not be who I wanted to be
or say what I actually thought,
and humanity at this time
completely identified with me.
I think both of us
were going through our midlife crisis,
and humanity, like me,
was becoming an overexposed prima donna.
I started to sell everything,
from hair oil to diesel generators.
Humanity was buying everything
from crude oil to nuclear reactors.
You know, I even tried
to get into a skintight superhero suit
to reinvent myself.
I must admit I failed miserably.
And just an aside I want to say
on behalf of all the Batmen, Spider-Men
and Supermen of the world,
you have to commend them,
because it really hurts in the crotch,
that superhero suit.




 8:39


(Laughter)




 8:40


Yeah, I'm being honest.
I need to tell you this here.
Really.
And accidentally, I happened
to even invent a new dance form
which I didn't realize,
and it became a rage.
So if it's all right,
and you've seen a bit of me,
so I'm quite shameless, I'll show you.
It was called the Lungi dance.
So if it's all right, I'll just show you.
I'm talented otherwise.




 9:00


(Cheers)




 9:02


So it went something like this.




 9:04


Lungi dance. Lungi dance.
Lungi dance. Lungi dance.
Lungi dance. Lungi dance.
Lungi dance. Lungi dance.
Lungi dance. Lungi dance.
Lungi dance. Lungi.




 9:12


That's it. It became a rage.




 9:14


(Cheers)




 9:15


It really did.
Like you notice, nobody could make
any sense of what was happening except me,
and I didn't give a damn, really,
because the whole world,
and whole humanity,
seemed as confused and lost as I was.
I didn't give up then.
I even tried to reconstruct
my identity on the social media
like everyone else does.
I thought if I put on
philosophical tweets out there
people will think I'm with it,
but some of the responses I got
from those tweets
were extremely confusing acronyms
which I didn't understand. You know?
ROFL, LOL.
""Adidas,"" somebody wrote back
to one of my more thought-provoking tweets
and I was wondering
why would you name a sneaker,
I mean, why would you write back
the name of a sneaker to me?
And I asked my 16-year-old daughter,
and she enlightened me.
""Adidas"" now means
""All day I dream about sex.""




10:03


(Laughter)




10:05


Really.
I didn't know if you know that.
So I wrote back,
""WTF"" in bold to Mr. Adidas,
thanking secretly that some acronyms
and things won't change at all.
WTF.




10:21


But here we are.
I am 51 years old, like I told you,
and mind-numbing acronyms notwithstanding,
I just want to tell you
if there has been a momentous time
for humanity to exist,
it is now,
because the present you is brave.
The present you is hopeful.
The present you
is innovative and resourceful,
and of course, the present you
is annoyingly indefinable.
And in this spell-binding,
imperfect moment of existence,
feeling a little brave
just before I came here,
I decided to take
a good, hard look at my face.
And I realized that I'm beginning
to look more and more
like the wax statue of me
at Madame Tussaud's.




11:04


(Laughter)




11:07


Yeah, and in that moment of realization,
I asked the most central
and pertinent question to humanity and me:
Do I need to fix my face?
Really. I'm an actor, like I told you,
a modern expression of human creativity.
The land I come from
is the source of inexplicable
but very simple spirituality.
In its immense generosity,
India decided somehow
that I, the Muslim son
of a broke freedom fighter
who accidentally ventured
into the business of selling dreams,
should become its king of romance,
the ""Badhshah of Bollywood,""
the greatest lover
the country has ever seen ...
with this face.
Yeah.




12:01


(Laughter)




12:02


Which has alternately
been described as ugly, unconventional,
and strangely, not chocolatey enough.




12:07


(Laughter)




12:12


The people of this ancient land
embraced me in their limitless love,
and I've learned from these people
that neither power nor poverty
can make your life more magical
or less tortuous.
I've learned from the people of my country
that the dignity of a life,
a human being, a culture,
a religion, a country
actually resides in its ability
for grace and compassion.
I've learned that whatever moves you,
whatever urges you to create, to build,
whatever keeps you from failing,
whatever helps you survive,
is perhaps the oldest and the simplest
emotion known to mankind,
and that is love.
A mystic poet from my land famously wrote,




13:01


(Recites poem in Hindi)




13:12


(Poem ends)




13:13


Which loosely translates
into that whatever 
yeah, if you know Hindi,
please clap, yeah.




13:18


(Applause)




13:19


It's very difficult to remember.
Which loosely translates
into actually saying
that all the books of knowledge
that you might read
and then go ahead
and impart your knowledge
through innovation,
through creativity, through technology,
but mankind will never be
the wiser about its future
unless it is coupled with a sense of love
and compassion for their fellow beings.
The two and a half alphabets
which form the word "",""
which means ""love,""
if you are able to understand that
and practice it,
that itself is enough
to enlighten mankind.
So I truly believe the future ""you""
has to be a you that loves.
Otherwise it will cease to flourish.
It will perish in its own self-absorption.




14:09


So you may use your power
to build walls
and keep people outside,
or you may use it to break barriers
and welcome them in.
You may use your faith
to make people afraid
and terrify them into submission,
or you can use it
to give courage to people
so they rise to the greatest
heights of enlightenment.
You can use your energy
to build nuclear bombs
and spread the darkness of destruction,
or you can use it to spread
the joy of light to millions.
You may filthy up the oceans callously
and cut down all the forests.
You can destroy the ecology,
or turn to them with love
and regenerate life
from the waters and trees.
You may land on Mars
and build armed citadels,
or you may look for life-forms and species
to learn from and respect.
And you can use
all the moneys we all have earned
to wage futile wars
and give guns in the hands
of little children
to kill each other with,
or you can use it
to make more food
to fill their stomachs with.




15:25


My country has taught me
the capacity for a human being to love
is akin to godliness.
It shines forth in a world
which civilization, I think,
already has tampered too much with.
In the last few days,
the talks here, the wonderful people
coming and showing their talent,
talking about individual achievements,
the innovation, the technology,
the sciences, the knowledge
we are gaining by being here
in the presence of TED Talks
and all of you
are reasons enough
for us to celebrate the future ""us.""
But within that celebration
the quest to cultivate
our capacity for love and compassion
has to assert itself,
has to assert itself,
just as equally.




16:14


So I believe the future ""you""
is an infinite you.
It's called a chakra
in India, like a circle.
It ends where it begins from
to complete itself.
A you that perceives
time and space differently
understands both
your unimaginable
and fantastic importance
and your complete unimportance
in the larger context of the universe.
A you that returns back
to the original innocence of humanity,
which loves from the purity of heart,
which sees from the eyes of truth,
which dreams from the clarity
of an untampered mind.




17:07


The future ""you"" has to be
like an aging movie star
who has been made to believe
that there is a possibility
of a world which is completely,
wholly, self-obsessively
in love with itself.
A world  really, it has to be a you
to create a world
which is its own best lover.
That I believe, ladies and gentlemen,
should be the future ""you.""




17:34


Thank you very much.
Shukriya.




17:37


(Applause)




17:39


Thank you.




17:40


(Applause)




17:43


Thank you.

This is Lee Sedol.
Lee Sedol is one of the world's
greatest Go players,
and he's having what my friends
in Silicon Valley call
a ""Holy Cow"" moment 




 0:21


(Laughter)




 0:22


a moment where we realize
that AI is actually progressing
a lot faster than we expected.
So humans have lost on the Go board.
What about the real world?




 0:32


Well, the real world is much bigger,
much more complicated than the Go board.
It's a lot less visible,
but it's still a decision problem.
And if we think about some
of the technologies
that are coming down the pike ...
Noriko [Arai] mentioned that reading
is not yet happening in machines,
at least with understanding.
But that will happen,
and when that happens,
very soon afterwards,
machines will have read everything
that the human race has ever written.
And that will enable machines,
along with the ability to look
further ahead than humans can,
as we've already seen in Go,
if they also have access
to more information,
they'll be able to make better decisions
in the real world than we can.
So is that a good thing?
Well, I hope so.




 1:25


Our entire civilization,
everything that we value,
is based on our intelligence.
And if we had access
to a lot more intelligence,
then there's really no limit
to what the human race can do.
And I think this could be,
as some people have described it,
the biggest event in human history.
So why are people saying things like this,
that AI might spell the end
of the human race?
Is this a new thing?
Is it just Elon Musk and Bill Gates
and Stephen Hawking?




 2:00


Actually, no. This idea
has been around for a while.
Here's a quotation:
""Even if we could keep the machines
in a subservient position,
for instance, by turning off the power
at strategic moments"" 
and I'll come back to that
""turning off the power"" idea later on 
""we should, as a species,
feel greatly humbled.""
So who said this?
This is Alan Turing in 1951.
Alan Turing, as you know,
is the father of computer science
and in many ways,
the father of AI as well.
So if we think about this problem,
the problem of creating something
more intelligent than your own species,
we might call this ""the gorilla problem,""
because gorillas' ancestors did this
a few million years ago,
and now we can ask the gorillas:
Was this a good idea?




 2:48


So here they are having a meeting
to discuss whether it was a good idea,
and after a little while,
they conclude, no,
this was a terrible idea.
Our species is in dire straits.
In fact, you can see the existential
sadness in their eyes.




 3:03


(Laughter)




 3:05


So this queasy feeling that making
something smarter than your own species
is maybe not a good idea 
what can we do about that?
Well, really nothing,
except stop doing AI,
and because of all
the benefits that I mentioned
and because I'm an AI researcher,
I'm not having that.
I actually want to be able
to keep doing AI.




 3:29


So we actually need to nail down
the problem a bit more.
What exactly is the problem?
Why is better AI possibly a catastrophe?




 3:38


So here's another quotation:
""We had better be quite sure
that the purpose put into the machine
is the purpose which we really desire.""
This was said by Norbert Wiener in 1960,
shortly after he watched
one of the very early learning systems
learn to play checkers
better than its creator.
But this could equally have been said
by King Midas.
King Midas said, ""I want everything
I touch to turn to gold,""
and he got exactly what he asked for.
That was the purpose
that he put into the machine,
so to speak,
and then his food and his drink
and his relatives turned to gold
and he died in misery and starvation.
So we'll call this
""the King Midas problem""
of stating an objective
which is not, in fact,
truly aligned with what we want.
In modern terms, we call this
""the value alignment problem.""




 4:36


Putting in the wrong objective
is not the only part of the problem.
There's another part.
If you put an objective into a machine,
even something as simple as,
""Fetch the coffee,""
the machine says to itself,
""Well, how might I fail
to fetch the coffee?
Someone might switch me off.
OK, I have to take steps to prevent that.
I will disable my 'off' switch.
I will do anything to defend myself
against interference
with this objective
that I have been given.""
So this single-minded pursuit
in a very defensive mode
of an objective that is, in fact,
not aligned with the true objectives
of the human race 
that's the problem that we face.
And in fact, that's the high-value
takeaway from this talk.
If you want to remember one thing,
it's that you can't fetch
the coffee if you're dead.




 5:27


(Laughter)




 5:28


It's very simple. Just remember that.
Repeat it to yourself three times a day.




 5:32


(Laughter)




 5:34


And in fact, this is exactly the plot
of ""2001: [A Space Odyssey]""
HAL has an objective, a mission,
which is not aligned
with the objectives of the humans,
and that leads to this conflict.
Now fortunately, HAL
is not superintelligent.
He's pretty smart,
but eventually Dave outwits him
and manages to switch him off.
But we might not be so lucky.
So what are we going to do?




 6:11


I'm trying to redefine AI
to get away from this classical notion
of machines that intelligently
pursue objectives.
There are three principles involved.
The first one is a principle
of altruism, if you like,
that the robot's only objective
is to maximize the realization
of human objectives,
of human values.
And by values here I don't mean
touchy-feely, goody-goody values.
I just mean whatever it is
that the human would prefer
their life to be like.
And so this actually violates Asimov's law
that the robot has to protect
its own existence.
It has no interest in preserving
its existence whatsoever.




 6:56


The second law is a law
of humility, if you like.
And this turns out to be really
important to make robots safe.
It says that the robot does not know
what those human values are,
so it has to maximize them,
but it doesn't know what they are.
And that avoids this problem
of single-minded pursuit
of an objective.
This uncertainty turns out to be crucial.




 7:20


Now, in order to be useful to us,
it has to have some idea of what we want.
It obtains that information primarily
by observation of human choices,
so our own choices reveal information
about what it is that we prefer
our lives to be like.
So those are the three principles.
Let's see how that applies
to this question of:
""Can you switch the machine off?""
as Turing suggested.




 7:48


So here's a PR2 robot.
This is one that we have in our lab,
and it has a big red ""off"" switch
right on the back.
The question is: Is it
going to let you switch it off?
If we do it the classical way,
we give it the objective of, ""Fetch
the coffee, I must fetch the coffee,
I can't fetch the coffee if I'm dead,""
so obviously the PR2
has been listening to my talk,
and so it says, therefore,
""I must disable my 'off' switch,
and probably taser all the other
people in Starbucks
who might interfere with me.""




 8:18


(Laughter)




 8:20


So this seems to be inevitable, right?
This kind of failure mode
seems to be inevitable,
and it follows from having
a concrete, definite objective.




 8:29


So what happens if the machine
is uncertain about the objective?
Well, it reasons in a different way.
It says, ""OK, the human
might switch me off,
but only if I'm doing something wrong.
Well, I don't really know what wrong is,
but I know that I don't want to do it.""
So that's the first and second
principles right there.
""So I should let the human switch me off.""
And in fact you can calculate
the incentive that the robot has
to allow the human to switch it off,
and it's directly tied to the degree
of uncertainty about
the underlying objective.




 9:04


And then when the machine is switched off,
that third principle comes into play.
It learns something about the objectives
it should be pursuing,
because it learns that
what it did wasn't right.
In fact, we can, with suitable use
of Greek symbols,
as mathematicians usually do,
we can actually prove a theorem
that says that such a robot
is provably beneficial to the human.
You are provably better off
with a machine that's designed in this way
than without it.
So this is a very simple example,
but this is the first step
in what we're trying to do
with human-compatible AI.




 9:41


Now, this third principle,
I think is the one that you're probably
scratching your head over.
You're probably thinking, ""Well,
you know, I behave badly.
I don't want my robot to behave like me.
I sneak down in the middle of the night
and take stuff from the fridge.
I do this and that.""
There's all kinds of things
you don't want the robot doing.
But in fact, it doesn't
quite work that way.
Just because you behave badly
doesn't mean the robot
is going to copy your behavior.
It's going to understand your motivations
and maybe help you resist them,
if appropriate.
But it's still difficult.
What we're trying to do, in fact,
is to allow machines to predict
for any person and for any possible life
that they could live,
and the lives of everybody else:
Which would they prefer?
And there are many, many
difficulties involved in doing this;
I don't expect that this
is going to get solved very quickly.
The real difficulties, in fact, are us.




10:43


As I have already mentioned,
we behave badly.
In fact, some of us are downright nasty.
Now the robot, as I said,
doesn't have to copy the behavior.
The robot does not have
any objective of its own.
It's purely altruistic.
And it's not designed just to satisfy
the desires of one person, the user,
but in fact it has to respect
the preferences of everybody.
So it can deal with a certain
amount of nastiness,
and it can even understand
that your nastiness, for example,
you may take bribes as a passport official
because you need to feed your family
and send your kids to school.
It can understand that;
it doesn't mean it's going to steal.
In fact, it'll just help you
send your kids to school.




11:27


We are also computationally limited.
Lee Sedol is a brilliant Go player,
but he still lost.
So if we look at his actions,
he took an action that lost the game.
That doesn't mean he wanted to lose.
So to understand his behavior,
we actually have to invert
through a model of human cognition
that includes our computational
limitations  a very complicated model.
But it's still something
that we can work on understanding.




11:56


Probably the most difficult part,
from my point of view as an AI researcher,
is the fact that there are lots of us,
and so the machine has to somehow
trade off, weigh up the preferences
of many different people,
and there are different ways to do that.
Economists, sociologists,
moral philosophers have understood that,
and we are actively
looking for collaboration.




12:19


Let's have a look and see what happens
when you get that wrong.
So you can have
a conversation, for example,
with your intelligent personal assistant
that might be available
in a few years' time.
Think of a Siri on steroids.
So Siri says, ""Your wife called
to remind you about dinner tonight.""
And of course, you've forgotten.
""What? What dinner?
What are you talking about?""




12:41


""Uh, your 20th anniversary at 7pm.""




12:47


""I can't do that. I'm meeting
with the secretary-general at 7:30.
How could this have happened?""




12:53


""Well, I did warn you, but you overrode
my recommendation.""




12:59


""Well, what am I going to do?
I can't just tell him I'm too busy.""




13:03


""Don't worry. I arranged
for his plane to be delayed.""




13:06


(Laughter)




13:09


""Some kind of computer malfunction.""




13:11


(Laughter)




13:12


""Really? You can do that?""




13:15


""He sends his profound apologies
and looks forward to meeting you
for lunch tomorrow.""




13:20


(Laughter)




13:21


So the values here 
there's a slight mistake going on.
This is clearly following my wife's values
which is ""Happy wife, happy life.""




13:31


(Laughter)




13:32


It could go the other way.
You could come home
after a hard day's work,
and the computer says, ""Long day?""




13:39


""Yes, I didn't even have time for lunch.""




13:41


""You must be very hungry.""




13:42


""Starving, yeah.
Could you make some dinner?""




13:47


""There's something I need to tell you.""




13:49


(Laughter)




13:51


""There are humans in South Sudan
who are in more urgent need than you.""




13:56


(Laughter)




13:57


""So I'm leaving. Make your own dinner.""




13:59


(Laughter)




14:01


So we have to solve these problems,
and I'm looking forward
to working on them.




14:06


There are reasons for optimism.
One reason is,
there is a massive amount of data.
Because remember  I said
they're going to read everything
the human race has ever written.
Most of what we write about
is human beings doing things
and other people getting upset about it.
So there's a massive amount
of data to learn from.




14:22


There's also a very
strong economic incentive
to get this right.
So imagine your domestic robot's at home.
You're late from work again
and the robot has to feed the kids,
and the kids are hungry
and there's nothing in the fridge.
And the robot sees the cat.




14:38


(Laughter)




14:39


And the robot hasn't quite learned
the human value function properly,
so it doesn't understand
the sentimental value of the cat outweighs
the nutritional value of the cat.




14:50


(Laughter)




14:51


So then what happens?
Well, it happens like this:
""Deranged robot cooks kitty
for family dinner.""
That one incident would be the end
of the domestic robot industry.
So there's a huge incentive
to get this right
long before we reach
superintelligent machines.




15:11


So to summarize:
I'm actually trying to change
the definition of AI
so that we have provably
beneficial machines.
And the principles are:
machines that are altruistic,
that want to achieve only our objectives,
but that are uncertain
about what those objectives are,
and will watch all of us
to learn more about what it is
that we really want.
And hopefully in the process,
we will learn to be better people.
Thank you very much.




15:38


(Applause)




15:41


Chris Anderson: So interesting, Stuart.
We're going to stand here a bit
because I think they're setting up
for our next speaker.




15:48


A couple of questions.
So the idea of programming in ignorance
seems intuitively really powerful.
As you get to superintelligence,
what's going to stop a robot
reading literature and discovering
this idea that knowledge
is actually better than ignorance
and still just shifting its own goals
and rewriting that programming?




16:08


Stuart Russell: Yes, so we want
it to learn more, as I said,
about our objectives.
It'll only become more certain
as it becomes more correct,
so the evidence is there
and it's going to be designed
to interpret it correctly.
It will understand, for example,
that books are very biased
in the evidence they contain.
They only talk about kings and princes
and elite white male people doing stuff.
So it's a complicated problem,
but as it learns more about our objectives
it will become more and more useful to us.




16:45


CA: And you couldn't
just boil it down to one law,
you know, hardwired in:
""if any human ever tries to switch me off,
I comply. I comply.""




16:54


SR: Absolutely not.
That would be a terrible idea.
So imagine that you have
a self-driving car
and you want to send your five-year-old
off to preschool.
Do you want your five-year-old
to be able to switch off the car
while it's driving along?
Probably not.
So it needs to understand how rational
and sensible the person is.
The more rational the person,
the more willing you are
to be switched off.
If the person is completely
random or even malicious,
then you're less willing
to be switched off.




17:23


CA: All right. Stuart, can I just say,
I really, really hope you
figure this out for us.
Thank you so much for that talk.
That was amazing.




17:29


SR: Thank you.

I have a two-year-old daughter named Naya
who is under the mistaken impression
that this conference
is named in honor of her father.




 0:20


(Laughter)




 0:21


Who am I to contradict my baby girl?




 0:24


As many of you know, there's something
about becoming a parent
that concentrates the mind
on long-term problems like climate change.
It was the birth of my daughter
that inspired me
to launch this climate organization,
in order to counteract the excessive
polarization of this issue
in the United States,
and to find a conservative
pathway forward.
Yes, folks, a Republican
climate solution is possible,
and you know what?
It may even be better.




 0:57


(Laughter)




 0:59


Let me try to prove that to you.




 1:02


What we really need
is a killer app to climate policy.
In the technology world, a killer app
is an application so transformative
that it creates its own market,
like Uber.
In the climate world,
a killer app is a new
solution so promising
that it can break through
the seemingly insurmountable
barriers to progress.
These include the psychological barrier.
Climate advocates have long
been encouraging their fellow citizens
to make short-term sacrifices now
for benefits that accrue to other people
in other countries 30 or 40
years in the future.
It just doesn't fly because it runs
contrary to basic human nature.




 1:45


Next is the geopolitical barrier.
Under the current rules of global trade,
countries have a strong incentive
to free ride off the emissions reductions
of other nations,
instead of strengthening
their own programs.
This has been the curse
of every international
climate negotiations, including Paris.
Finally, we have the partisan barrier.
Even the most committed countries 
Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada 
are nowhere near reducing emissions
at the required scale and speed.
Not even close.
And the partisan climate divide
is far more acute
here in the United States.
We are fundamentally stuck,
and that is why we need
a killer app of climate policy
to break through each of these barriers.




 2:35


I'm convinced that the road
to climate progress in the United States
runs through the Republican Party
and the business community.
So in launching
the Climate Leadership Council,
I started by reaching out to a who's who
of Republican elder statesmen
and business leaders,
including James Baker and George Schultz,
the two most respected Republican
elder statesmen in America;
Martin Feldstein and Greg Mankiw,
the two most respected
conservative economists in the country;
and Henry Paulson and Rob Walton,
two of the most successful
and admired business leaders.
Together, we co-authored
""The Conservative Case
For Carbon Dividends.""
This represents the first time
that Republican leaders put forth
a concrete market-based climate solution.




 3:27


(Applause)




 3:28


Thank you.




 3:30


(Applause)




 3:32


We presented our plan at the White House
two weeks after President Trump moved in.
Almost every leading
editorial board in the country
has since endorsed our plan,
and Fortune 100 companies
from a wide range of industries
are now getting behind it.
So by now you're probably wondering,
what exactly is this plan?




 3:56


Well, our carbon dividends solution
is based on four pillars.
The first is a gradually
rising carbon tax.
Although capitalism is a wonderful system,
like many operating systems,
it's prone to bugs,
which, in this case, are called
""market failures.""
By far the largest is that
market prices fail to take
social and environmental
costs into account.
That means every market transaction
is based on incorrect information.
This fundamental bug of capitalism,
more than any other single factor,
is to blame for our climate predicament.




 4:33


Now in theory, this should be
an easy problem to fix.
Economists agree
that the best solution is to put a price
on the carbon content of fossil fuels,
otherwise known as a carbon tax.
This would discourage carbon emissions
in every single economic transaction,
every day of the year.
However, a carbon tax by itself
has proven to be unpopular
and a political dead end.
The answer is to return
all the money raised
directly to citizens,
in the form of equal monthly dividends.
This would transform
an unpopular carbon tax
into a popular and populist solution,
and it would also solve
the underlying psychological barrier
that we discussed,
by giving everyone a concrete benefit
in the here and now.




 5:28


And these benefits would be significant.
Assuming a carbon tax rate
that starts at 40 dollars per ton,
a family of four would receive
2,000 dollars per year
from the get-go.
According to the US Treasury Department,
the bottom 70 percent of Americans
would receive more in dividends
than they would pay
in increased energy prices.
That means 223 million Americans
would win economically
from solving climate change.
And that 




 6:01


(Applause)




 6:03


is revolutionary,
and could fundamentally
alter climate politics.




 6:09


But there's another
revolutionary element here.
The amount of the dividend would grow
as the carbon tax rate increases.
The more we protect our climate,
the more our citizens benefit.
This creates a positive feedback loop,
which is crucial,
because the only way we will reach
our long-term emission-reduction goals
is if the carbon tax rate
goes up every year.




 6:33


The third pillar of our program
is eliminating regulations
that are no longer needed
once a carbon dividends plan is enacted.
This is a key selling point
to Republicans and business leaders.
So why should we trade
climate regulations for a price on carbon?
Well, let me show you.
Our plan would achieve nearly twice
the emissions reductions
of all Obama-era climate
regulations combined,
and nearly three times the new baseline
after President Trump repeals
all of those regulations.
That assumes a carbon tax
starting at 40 dollars per ton,
which translates into roughly
an extra 36 cents per gallon of gas.
Our plan by itself
would meet the high end
of America's commitment
under the Paris Climate Agreement,
and as you can see,
the emissions reductions
would continue over time.
This illustrates the power
of a conservative climate solution
based on free markets
and limited government.
We would end up with less regulation
and far less pollution at the same time,
while helping working-class
Americans get ahead.
Doesn't that sound like something
we could all support?




 7:58


(Applause)




 8:04


The fourth and final pillar of our program
is a new climate domino effect,
based on border carbon adjustments.
Now that may sound complicated,
but it, too, is revolutionary,
because it provides us
a whole new strategy
to reach a global price on carbon,
which is ultimately what we need.
Let me show you an example.
Suppose Country A adopts
a carbon dividends plan,
and Country B does not.
Well, to level the playing field
and protect the competitiveness
of its industries,
Country A would tax imports from Country B
based on their carbon content.
Fair enough.
But here's where it gets
really interesting,
because the money raised at the border
would increase the dividends
going to the citizens of Country A.
Well, how long do you think it would take
the public in Country B to realize
that that money should be going to them,
and to push for a carbon
dividends plan in their own land?
Add a few more countries,
and we get a new climate domino effect.




 9:06


Once one major country or region
adopts carbon dividends
with border carbon adjustments,
other countries are compelled
to follow suit.
One by one the dominoes fall.
And this domino effect
could start anywhere.
My preference, strongly,
is the United States,
but it could also start
in the United Kingdom,
in Germany or another European country,
or even in China.




 9:31


Let's take China as an example.
China is committed to reducing
greenhouse gas emissions,
but what its leaders care even more about
is transitioning their economy
to consumer-led economic development.
Well, nothing could do more
to hasten that transition
than giving every Chinese citizen
a monthly dividend.
In fact, this is the only policy solution
that would enable China to meet
its environmental and economic goals
at the same time.




 9:59


That's why this is the killer app
of climate policy,
because it would enable us to overcome
each of the barriers we discussed earlier:
the psychological barrier,
the partisan barrier,
and, as we've just seen,
the geopolitical barrier.
All we need is a country to lead the way.
And one method of finding
what you're looking for
is to take out an ad.
So let's read this one together.




10:25


Wanted: country to pioneer
carbon dividends plan.
Cost to country: zero.
Starting date: as soon as possible.
Advantages: most effective
climate solution,
popular and populist,
pro-growth and pro-business,
shrinks government
and helps the working class.
Additional compensation: gratitude
of current and future generations,
including my daughter.




10:55


Thank you.




10:56


(Applause)




11:03


Chris Anderson: Just one
question for you, Ted.
I'm actually not sure
I've seen a conservative
get a standing O at TED before that.
That's pretty cool.
The logic seems really powerful,
but some people you talk to in politics
say it's hard to imagine this
still getting through Congress.
How are you feeling
about momentum behind this?




11:25


Ted Halstead: So I understand
that many are very pessimistic
about what's happening in
the United States with President Trump.
I'm less pessimistic; here's why.
The actions of this White House,
the early actions on climate,
are just the first move
in a complex game of climate chess.
So far it's been a repeal-only strategy;
the pressure is going to mount 
for a replacement program,
which is where we come in.
And there are three reasons why,
which I'll go through real quickly.




11:52


One, the business community
is fundamentally parting ways
with the White House on climate change.
In fact, we're finding
a number of Fortune 100 companies
supporting our program.
Within two months,
we're going to be announcing
some really surprising names
coming out in favor of this program.
Two, there is no issue
in American politics
where there's a more fundamental gap
between the Republican base
and the Republican leadership
than climate change.
And three, thinking of
this analogy of chess,
the big decision up ahead is:
Does the administration stay in Paris?
Well, let's pan it out both ways.
If it stays in Paris, as many
are pushing for in the administration,
well then that begs a question:
What's the plan?
We have the plan.
But if they don't stay in Paris,
the international pressure
will be overwhelming.
Our Secretary of State will be asking
other countries for NATO contributions,
and they'll be saying,
""No, give us our Paris commitment.
Come through on your commitments,
we'll come through on ours.""




12:50


So, international, business
and even the Republican base
will all be calling for
a Republican replacement plan.
And, hopefully, we've provided one.




13:00


CA: Thank you so much, Ted.




13:01


TH: Thank you, Chris.

2785,Rutger Bregman,Poverty isn't a lack of character; it's a lack of cash,http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/2785,"""Ideas can and do change the world,"" says historian Rutger Bregman, sharing his case for a provocative one: guaranteed basic income. Learn more about the idea's 500-year history and a forgotten modern experiment where it actually worked -- and imagine how much energy and talent we would unleash if we got rid of poverty once and for all.",http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/2785/transcript?language=en,4,2017,TED2017,0:14:58,5/22/17,843230,"economics,work,money,policy,capitalism,resources,social change,inequality,society","0:12


I'd like to start with a simple question:
Why do the poor make
so many poor decisions?
I know it's a harsh question,
but take a look at the data.
The poor borrow more, save less,
smoke more, exercise less, drink more
and eat less healthfully.
Why?




 0:35


Well, the standard explanation
was once summed up by the British
Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher.
And she called poverty
""a personality defect.""




 0:43


(Laughter)




 0:45


A lack of character, basically.




 0:48


Now, I'm sure not many of you
would be so blunt.
But the idea that there's something
wrong with the poor themselves
is not restricted to Mrs. Thatcher.
Some of you may believe that the poor
should be held responsible
for their own mistakes.
And others may argue that we should
help them to make better decisions.
But the underlying assumption is the same:
there's something wrong with them.
If we could just change them,
if we could just teach them
how to live their lives,
if they would only listen.
And to be honest,
this was what I thought for a long time.
It was only a few years ago
that I discovered
that everything I thought I knew
about poverty was wrong.




 1:37


It all started when I accidentally
stumbled upon a paper
by a few American psychologists.
They had traveled 8,000 miles,
all the way to India,
for a fascinating study.
And it was an experiment
with sugarcane farmers.
You should know that these farmers
collect about 60 percent
of their annual income all at once,
right after the harvest.
This means that they're relatively
poor one part of the year
and rich the other.
The researchers asked them to do
an IQ test before and after the harvest.
What they subsequently discovered
completely blew my mind.
The farmers scored much worse
on the test before the harvest.
The effects of living
in poverty, it turns out,
correspond to losing 14 points of IQ.
Now, to give you an idea,
that's comparable
to losing a night's sleep
or the effects of alcoholism.




 2:33


A few months later,
I heard that Eldar Shafir,
a professor at Princeton University
and one of the authors of this study,
was coming over to Holland, where I live.
So we met up in Amsterdam
to talk about his revolutionary
new theory of poverty.
And I can sum it up in just two words:
scarcity mentality.
It turns out that people
behave differently
when they perceive a thing to be scarce.
And what that thing is
doesn't much matter 
whether it's not enough time,
money or food.




 3:04


You all know this feeling,
when you've got too much to do,
or when you've put off breaking for lunch
and your blood sugar takes a dive.
This narrows your focus
to your immediate lack 
to the sandwich you've got to have now,
the meeting that's starting
in five minutes
or the bills that have
to be paid tomorrow.
So the long-term perspective
goes out the window.
You could compare it to a new computer
that's running 10 heavy programs at once.
It gets slower and slower, making errors.
Eventually, it freezes 
not because it's a bad computer,
but because it has too much to do at once.
The poor have the same problem.
They're not making dumb decisions
because they are dumb,
but because they're living in a context
in which anyone would make dumb decisions.




 3:53


So suddenly I understood
why so many of our anti-poverty
programs don't work.
Investments in education, for example,
are often completely ineffective.
Poverty is not a lack of knowledge.
A recent analysis of 201 studies
on the effectiveness
of money-management training
came to the conclusion
that it has almost no effect at all.
Now, don't get me wrong 
this is not to say the poor
don't learn anything 
they can come out wiser for sure.
But it's not enough.
Or as Professor Shafir told me,
""It's like teaching someone to swim
and then throwing them in a stormy sea.""




 4:35


I still remember sitting there,
perplexed.
And it struck me
that we could have figured
this all out decades ago.
I mean, these psychologists didn't need
any complicated brain scans;
they only had to measure the farmer's IQ,
and IQ tests were invented
more than 100 years ago.
Actually, I realized I had read about
the psychology of poverty before.
George Orwell, one of the greatest
writers who ever lived,
experienced poverty
firsthand in the 1920s.
""The essence of poverty,""
he wrote back then,
is that it ""annihilates the future.""
And he marveled at, quote,
""How people take it for granted
they have the right to preach at you
and pray over you
as soon as your income falls
below a certain level.""




 5:19


Now, those words are every bit
as resonant today.
The big question is, of course:
What can be done?
Modern economists have
a few solutions up their sleeves.
We could help the poor
with their paperwork
or send them a text message
to remind them to pay their bills.
This type of solution is hugely popular
with modern politicians,
mostly because,
well, they cost next to nothing.
These solutions are, I think,
a symbol of this era
in which we so often treat the symptoms,
but ignore the underlying cause.




 5:56


So I wonder:
Why don't we just change the context
in which the poor live?
Or, going back to our computer analogy:
Why keep tinkering around
with the software
when we can easily solve the problem
by installing some extra memory instead?
At that point, Professor Shafir
responded with a blank look.
And after a few seconds, he said,
""Oh, I get it.
You mean you want to just hand out
more money to the poor
to eradicate poverty.
Uh, sure, that'd be great.
But I'm afraid that brand
of left-wing politics
you've got in Amsterdam 
it doesn't exist in the States.""




 6:37


But is this really
an old-fashioned, leftist idea?
I remembered reading about an old plan 
something that has been proposed
by some of history's leading thinkers.
The philosopher Thomas More
first hinted at it in his book, ""Utopia,""
more than 500 years ago.
And its proponents have spanned
the spectrum from the left to the right,
from the civil rights campaigner,
Martin Luther King,
to the economist Milton Friedman.
And it's an incredibly simple idea:
basic income guarantee.




 7:12


What it is?
Well, that's easy.
It's a monthly grant, enough to pay
for your basic needs:
food, shelter, education.
It's completely unconditional,
so no one's going to tell you
what you have to do for it,
and no one's going to tell you
what you have to do with it.
The basic income
is not a favor, but a right.
There's absolutely no stigma attached.
So as I learned about the true
nature of poverty,
I couldn't stop wondering:
Is this the idea
we've all been waiting for?
Could it really be that simple?
And in the three years that followed,
I read everything I could find
about basic income.
I researched the dozens of experiments
that have been conducted
all over the globe,
and it didn't take long before I stumbled
upon a story of a town
that had done it 
had actually eradicated poverty.
But then ...
nearly everyone forgot about it.




 8:04


This story starts in Dauphin, Canada.
In 1974, everybody in this small town
was guaranteed a basic income,
ensuring that no one fell
below the poverty line.
At the start of the experiment,
an army of researchers
descended on the town.
For four years, all went well.
But then a new government
was voted into power,
and the new Canadian cabinet saw
little point to the expensive experiment.
So when it became clear there was
no money left to analyze the results,
the researchers decided to pack
their files away in some 2,000 boxes.
Twenty-five years went by,
and then Evelyn Forget,
a Canadian professor,
found the records.
For three years, she subjected the data
to all manner of statistical analysis,
and no matter what she tried,
the results were the same every time:
the experiment had been
a resounding success.




 9:04


Evelyn Forget discovered
that the people in Dauphin
had not only become richer
but also smarter and healthier.
The school performance of kids
improved substantially.
The hospitalization rate decreased
by as much as 8.5 percent.
Domestic violence incidents were down,
as were mental health complaints.
And people didn't quit their jobs.
The only ones who worked a little less
were new mothers and students 
who stayed in school longer.
Similar results have since been found
in countless other experiments
around the globe,
from the US to India.




 9:40


So ...
here's what I've learned.
When it comes to poverty,
we, the rich, should stop
pretending we know best.
We should stop sending shoes
and teddy bears to the poor,
to people we have never met.
And we should get rid of the vast
industry of paternalistic bureaucrats
when we could simply
hand over their salaries
to the poor they're supposed to help.




10:05


(Applause)




10:07


Because, I mean, the great
thing about money
is that people can use it
to buy things they need
instead of things that self-appointed
experts think they need.
Just imagine how many brilliant scientists
and entrepreneurs and writers,
like George Orwell,
are now withering away in scarcity.
Imagine how much energy
and talent we would unleash
if we got rid of poverty once and for all.
I believe that a basic income would work
like venture capital for the people.
And we can't afford not to do it,
because poverty is hugely expensive.
Just look at the cost of child poverty
in the US, for example.
It's estimated at 500 billion
dollars each year,
in terms of higher health care
spending, higher dropout rates,
and more crime.
Now, this is an incredible waste
of human potential.




10:59


But let's talk about
the elephant in the room.
How could we ever afford
a basic income guarantee?
Well, it's actually a lot cheaper
than you may think.
What they did in Dauphin is finance it
with a negative income tax.
This means that your income is topped up
as soon as you fall
below the poverty line.
And in that scenario,
according to our economists'
best estimates,
for a net cost of 175 billion 
a quarter of US military spending,
one percent of GDP 
you could lift all impoverished Americans
above the poverty line.
You could actually eradicate poverty.
Now, that should be our goal.




11:39


(Applause)




11:40


The time for small thoughts
and little nudges is past.
I really believe that the time has come
for radical new ideas,
and basic income is so much more
than just another policy.
It is also a complete rethink
of what work actually is.
And in that sense,
it will not only free the poor,
but also the rest of us.




12:02


Nowadays, millions of people feel
that their jobs have little
meaning or significance.
A recent poll among 230,000 employees
in 142 countries
found that only 13 percent of workers
actually like their job.
And another poll found that as much
as 37 percent of British workers
have a job that they think
doesn't even need to exist.
It's like Brad Pitt says in ""Fight Club,""
""Too often we're working jobs we hate
so we can buy shit we don't need.""




12:31


(Laughter)




12:32


Now, don't get me wrong 
I'm not talking about the teachers
and the garbagemen
and the care workers here.
If they stopped working,
we'd be in trouble.
I'm talking about all those well-paid
professionals with excellent rsums
who earn their money doing ...
strategic transactor peer-to-peer meetings
while brainstorming the value
add-on of disruptive co-creation
in the network society.




12:53


(Laughter)




12:54


(Applause)




12:55


Or something like that.
Just imagine again how much
talent we're wasting,
simply because we tell our kids
they'll have to ""earn a living.""
Or think of what a math whiz working
at Facebook lamented a few years ago:
""The best minds of my generation
are thinking about how
to make people click ads.""




13:15


I'm a historian.
And if history teaches us anything,
it is that things could be different.
There is nothing inevitable
about the way we structured our society
and economy right now.
Ideas can and do change the world.
And I think that especially
in the past few years,
it has become abundantly clear
that we cannot stick to the status quo 
that we need new ideas.




13:39


I know that many of you
may feel pessimistic
about a future of rising inequality,
xenophobia
and climate change.
But it's not enough
to know what we're against.
We also need to be for something.
Martin Luther King didn't say,
""I have a nightmare.""




13:54


(Laughter)




13:56


He had a dream.




13:57


(Applause)




13:58


So ...
here's my dream:
I believe in a future
where the value of your work
is not determined
by the size of your paycheck,
but by the amount of happiness you spread
and the amount of meaning you give.
I believe in a future
where the point of education is not
to prepare you for another useless job
but for a life well-lived.
I believe in a future
where an existence
without poverty is not a privilege
but a right we all deserve.
So here we are.
Here we are.
We've got the research,
we've got the evidence
and we've got the means.




14:32


Now, more than 500 years after Thomas More
first wrote about a basic income,
and 100 years after George Orwell
discovered the true nature of poverty,
we all need to change our worldview,
because poverty
is not a lack of character.
Poverty is a lack of cash.




14:50


Thank you.

Now, she advocates for others who are yet to find their voices, cutting through stigma and exclusion to talk about what it's like to live with the condition.",http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/2786/transcript?language=en,2,2017,TEDNairobi Ideas Search,0:08:29,5/23/17,362002,"Africa,mental health,identity,community,personal growth,humanity,social change,communication,health,society","0:11


I have a confession.
I have been in an affair
since I was 17 years old.
I wish I could talk about
butterflies in my stomach
or maps I drew on the ground
when I think about this affair,
but I cannot.
I wish I could talk about
sweet words spoken
or gifts that I received
from this affair,
but I cannot.
All I can tell you about is the aftermath,
about days I spent constantly asking:
Why, why, why me?




 0:56


I remember how it all began.
I was in my final year of high school,
and my class had just won in sports,
so we were singing and dancing
and hugging each other.
I went and took a shower.
Then I went for dinner.
And when I sat down to eat,
my teeth started chattering,
and so I couldn't put
the spoon in my mouth.
I rushed to the nurse's office,
and because I couldn't talk,
I just pointed at my mouth.
She didn't know what was happening,
so she told me to lie down,
and it worked 
after a few minutes,
the chattering stopped.
I was about to dash out,
and she told me 
no, she insisted  that I go up
to the dormitories to sleep.
Here I was in my final year
of high school,
just a few months from doing
my end of high school exams
and a few days from doing a set
of exams we call here in Kenya ""mocks,""
which are somehow meant to gauge
how prepared one is for the final exams.
There is no way I was going to sleep
and let a set of exams mock me.




 2:08


I went to class, sat down,
took my Kenyan history notes,
and there I was, down Kenyan coastal town,
with the great Mekatilili wa Menza,
the Giriama woman who led her people
against British colonial rule.
Then, without any notice,
my left hand started jerking,
and it was as if I was marking
imaginary papers.
In and out it went,
and with every stroke, one by one,
my classmates stopped
concentrating on their reading
and started looking at me.
And I tried really hard to stop it,
but I couldn't,
because it had a life of its own.
And then, when it was sure
everybody was looking at us,
in its final show
and official introduction,
I had my first full-blown seizure,
which was the beginning of what
has been a 15-year-long affair.




 3:16


Seizures are the trademark characteristic
for most types of epilepsy,
and every first-ever seizure
needs to be assessed by a doctor
to determine if one has epilepsy
or if it's a symptom of something else.
In my case, it was confirmed
that I had epilepsy.
I spent a large chunk of my time
in hospital and at home,
and only went back to do my final exams.
I had seizures in between papers,
but managed to get good enough grades
to be admitted for an actuarial
science degree
at the University of Nairobi.




 3:57


(Applause)




 4:03


Unfortunately, I had to drop out
in my second year.
I didn't have good enough coping skills
and a support community around me.
I was lucky enough to get a job,
but I was fired from that job
when I had a seizure in the workplace.




 4:21


So I found myself in a space
where I was constantly asking myself
why this had to happen to me.
I lived in denial for a long time,
and the denial was maybe because
of the things that had happened,
dropping out of school
and being fired from my job.
Or maybe it was because of the things
I had heard about epilepsy
and about people living with epilepsy:
that they would never live on their own;
that they would never travel on their own
or even get work;
that they were outcasts,
with a spirit in them that they needed
to be delivered from.




 5:07


And so the more I thought
about these things,
the more my seizures became,
and I spent days with my legs locked,
my speech became blurred
and on days on end, this is how I'd be.
Two or three days after a seizure,
my head and my hand
would still be twitching.
I felt lost,
like I'd lost everything,
and sometimes,
even the will to live.




 5:52


(Sigh)




 5:59


I had so much frustration in me.
And so I started writing,
because the people around me
didn't have answers
to the questions that I had.
And so I wrote my fears
and my doubts.
I wrote about my good days
and my bad days and my really ugly days,
and I shared them on a blog.
And before long,
I began to be seen and heard
by people who had epilepsy
and their families,
and even those who did not
have the diagnosis.
And I moved from that girl
who constantly asked why me
to one who not only self-advocates,
but does it for those who are yet
to find their voices.




 6:46


(Applause)




 6:54


My seizures are greatly reduced,
from two to three times a day,
to sometimes two to three
times in one year.




 7:01


I went on 




 7:02


(Applause)




 7:08


I went on to employ five people,
when I began what was Kenya's first
free mental health
and epilepsy support line.




 7:16


And I travel 




 7:18


(Applause)




 7:20


And I travel to speak about my affair,
all these things that I had been told
people like me living with epilepsy
could never be able to do.




 7:32


Every year, a population
as big as 80 percent of Nairobi
gets diagnosed with epilepsy
across the globe.
And they, like me,
go through the emotions
of stigma and exclusion.
And so I have made it my life journey
to keep these conversations going,
and I keep confessing about my affair
so that those people who do not
have the diagnosis
might know and might have
a constant reminder
that it is alright to engage
with people like us,
that as long as they pull down
the walls of stigma and exclusion,
that we, just like them,
can be able to take anything
life throws at us.




 8:20


Thank you.

2787,Garry Kasparov,Don't fear intelligent machines. Work with them,http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/2787,"We must face our fears if we want to get the most out of technology  and we must conquer those fears if we want to get the best out of humanity, says Garry Kasparov. One of the greatest chess players in history, Kasparov lost a memorable match to IBM supercomputer Deep Blue in 1997.

This story begins in 1985,
when at age 22,
I became the World Chess Champion
after beating Anatoly Karpov.
Earlier that year,
I played what is called
simultaneous exhibition
against 32 of the world's
best chess-playing machines
in Hamburg, Germany.
I won all the games,
and then it was not considered
much of a surprise
that I could beat 32 computers
at the same time.
To me, that was the golden age.




 0:48


(Laughter)




 0:50


Machines were weak,
and my hair was strong.




 0:54


(Laughter)




 0:57


Just 12 years later,
I was fighting for my life
against just one computer
in a match
called by the cover of ""Newsweek""
""The Brain's Last Stand.""
No pressure.




 1:11


(Laughter)




 1:14


From mythology to science fiction,
human versus machine
has been often portrayed
as a matter of life and death.
John Henry,
called the steel-driving man
in the 19th century
African American folk legend,
was pitted in a race
against a steam-powered hammer
bashing a tunnel through mountain rock.
John Henry's legend
is a part of a long historical narrative
pitting humanity versus technology.
And this competitive rhetoric
is standard now.
We are in a race against the machines,
in a fight or even in a war.
Jobs are being killed off.
People are being replaced
as if they had vanished from the Earth.
It's enough to think that the movies
like ""The Terminator"" or ""The Matrix""
are nonfiction.




 2:10


There are very few instances of an arena
where the human body and mind
can compete on equal terms
with a computer or a robot.
Actually, I wish there were a few more.
Instead,
it was my blessing and my curse
to literally become the proverbial man
in the man versus machine competition
that everybody is still talking about.
In the most famous human-machine
competition since John Henry,
I played two matches
against the IBM supercomputer, Deep Blue.
Nobody remembers
that I won the first match 




 3:00


(Laughter)




 3:02


(Applause)




 3:06


In Philadelphia, before losing the rematch
the following year in New York.
But I guess that's fair.
There is no day in history,
special calendar entry
for all the people
who failed to climb Mt. Everest
before Sir Edmund Hillary
and Tenzing Norgay
made it to the top.
And in 1997, I was still
the world champion
when chess computers finally came of age.
I was Mt. Everest,
and Deep Blue reached the summit.
I should say of course,
not that Deep Blue did it,
but its human creators 
Anantharaman, Campbell, Hoane, Hsu.
Hats off to them.
As always, machine's triumph
was a human triumph,
something we tend to forget when humans
are surpassed by our own creations.




 4:09


Deep Blue was victorious,
but was it intelligent?
No, no it wasn't,
at least not in the way Alan Turing
and other founders of computer science
had hoped.
It turned out that chess
could be crunched by brute force,
once hardware got fast enough
and algorithms got smart enough.
Although by the definition of the output,
grandmaster-level chess,
Deep Blue was intelligent.
But even at the incredible speed,
200 million positions per second,
Deep Blue's method
provided little of the dreamed-of insight
into the mysteries of human intelligence.




 5:07


Soon,
machines will be taxi drivers
and doctors and professors,
but will they be ""intelligent?""
I would rather leave these definitions
to the philosophers and to the dictionary.
What really matters is how we humans
feel about living and working
with these machines.




 5:37


When I first met Deep Blue
in 1996 in February,
I had been the world champion
for more than 10 years,
and I had played 182
world championship games
and hundreds of games against
other top players in other competitions.
I knew what to expect from my opponents
and what to expect from myself.
I was used to measure their moves
and to gauge their emotional state
by watching their body language
and looking into their eyes.




 6:16


And then I sat across
the chessboard from Deep Blue.
I immediately sensed something new,
something unsettling.
You might experience a similar feeling
the first time you ride
in a driverless car
or the first time your new computer
manager issues an order at work.
But when I sat at that first game,
I couldn't be sure
what is this thing capable of.
Technology can advance in leaps,
and IBM had invested heavily.
I lost that game.
And I couldn't help wondering,
might it be invincible?
Was my beloved game of chess over?
These were human doubts, human fears,
and the only thing I knew for sure
was that my opponent Deep Blue
had no such worries at all.




 7:21


(Laughter)




 7:24


I fought back
after this devastating blow
to win the first match,
but the writing was on the wall.
I eventually lost to the machine
but I didn't suffer the fate of John Henry
who won but died
with his hammer in his hand.
It turned out that the world of chess
still wanted to have
a human chess champion.
And even today,
when a free chess app
on the latest mobile phone
is stronger than Deep Blue,
people are still playing chess,
even more than ever before.
Doomsayers predicted
that nobody would touch the game
that could be conquered by the machine,
and they were wrong, proven wrong,
but doomsaying has always been
a popular pastime
when it comes to technology.




 8:25


What I learned from my own experience
is that we must face our fears
if we want to get the most
out of our technology,
and we must conquer those fears
if we want to get the best
out of our humanity.
While licking my wounds,
I got a lot of inspiration
from my battles against Deep Blue.
As the old Russian saying goes,
if you can't beat them, join them.
Then I thought,
what if I could play with a computer 
together with a computer at my side,
combining our strengths,
human intuition
plus machine's calculation,
human strategy, machine tactics,
human experience, machine's memory.
Could it be the perfect game ever played?




 9:21


My idea came to life
in 1998 under the name of Advanced Chess
when I played this human-plus-machine
competition against another elite player.
But in this first experiment,
we both failed to combine
human and machine skills effectively.
Advanced Chess found
its home on the internet,
and in 2005, a so-called
freestyle chess tournament
produced a revelation.
A team of grandmasters
and top machines participated,
but the winners were not grandmasters,
not a supercomputer.
The winners were a pair
of amateur American chess players
operating three ordinary PCs
at the same time.
Their skill of coaching their machines
effectively counteracted
the superior chess knowledge
of their grandmaster opponents
and much greater
computational power of others.
And I reached this formulation.
A weak human player plus a machine
plus a better process is superior
to a very powerful machine alone,
but more remarkably,
is superior to a strong human player
plus machine
and an inferior process.
This convinced me that we would need
better interfaces
to help us coach our machines
towards more useful intelligence.




11:09


Human plus machine isn't the future,
it's the present.
Everybody that's used online translation
to get the gist of a news article
from a foreign newspaper,
knowing its far from perfect.
Then we use our human experience
to make sense out of that,
and then the machine
learns from our corrections.
This model is spreading and investing
in medical diagnosis, security analysis.
The machine crunches data,
calculates probabilities,
gets 80 percent of the way, 90 percent,
making it easier for analysis
and decision-making of the human party.
But you are not going to send your kids
to school in a self-driving car
with 90 percent accuracy,
even with 99 percent.
So we need a leap forward
to add a few more crucial decimal places.




12:18


Twenty years after
my match with Deep Blue,
second match,
this sensational
""The Brain's Last Stand"" headline
has become commonplace
as intelligent machines
move
in every sector, seemingly every day.
But unlike in the past,
when machines replaced
farm animals, manual labor,
now they are coming
after people with college degrees
and political influence.
And as someone
who fought machines and lost,
I am here to tell you
this is excellent, excellent news.
Eventually, every profession
will have to feel these pressures
or else it will mean humanity
has ceased to make progress.
We don't
get to choose
when and where
technological progress stops.
We cannot
slow down.
In fact,
we have to speed up.
Our technology excels at removing
difficulties and uncertainties
from our lives,
and so we must seek out
ever more difficult,
ever more uncertain challenges.
Machines have
calculations.
We have understanding.
Machines have instructions.
We have purpose.
Machines have
objectivity.
We have passion.
We should not worry
about what our machines can do today.
Instead, we should worry
about what they still cannot do today,
because we will need the help
of the new, intelligent machines
to turn our grandest dreams into reality.
And if we fail,
if we fail, it's not because our machines
are too intelligent,
or not intelligent enough.
If we fail, it's because
we grew complacent
and limited our ambitions.
Our humanity is not defined by any skill,
like swinging a hammer
or even playing chess.




15:05


There's one thing only a human can do.
That's dream.
So let us dream big.




15:13


Thank you.

Parish County, Louisiana.




 0:25


T. Morgan Dixon: And my name is Morgan,
daughter of Carol,
daughter of Letha, daughter of Willie,
daughter of Sarah,
born 1849 in Bardstown, Kentucky.




 0:34


VG: And in the tradition of our families,
the great oral tradition
of almost every black church we know
honoring the culture
from which we draw so much power,
we're gonna start the way our mommas
and grandmas would want us to start.




 0:47


TMD: In prayer. Let the words of my mouth,
the meditation of our hearts,
be acceptable in thy sight,
oh Lord, my strength and my redeemer.




 0:57


VG: We call the names and rituals
of our ancestors into this room today
because from them we received
a powerful blueprint for survival,
strategies and tactics for healing
carried across oceans by African women,
passed down to generations
of black women in America
who used those skills
to navigate institutions of slavery
and state-sponsored discrimination
in order that we might
stand on this stage.
We walk in the footsteps of those women,
our foremothers, legends
like Ella Baker, Septima Clark,
Fannie Lou Hamer,
from whom we learned
the power of organizing
after she would had
single-handedly registered
60,000 voters in Jim Crow Mississippi.




 1:42


TMD: 60,000 is a lot of people,
so if you can imagine
me and Vanessa inspiring
60,000 women to walk with us last year,
we were fired up.
But today, 100,000 black women and girls
stand on this stage with us.
We are committed to healing ourselves,
to lacing up our sneakers,
to walking out of our front door
every single day for total healing
and transformation in our communities,
because we understand
that we are in the footsteps
of a civil rights legacy
like no other time before,
and that we are facing a health crisis
like never ever before.
And so we've had
a lot of moments, great moments,
including the time we had on our pajamas,
we were working on our computer
and Michelle Obama emailed us
and invited us to the White House,
and we thought it was spam.
But this moment here is an opportunity.
It is an opportunity
that we don't take for granted,
and so we thought long and hard
about how we would use it.
Would we talk to the women
we hope to inspire,
a million in the next year,
or would we talk to you?
We decided to talk to you,
and to talk to you about a question
that we get all the time,
so that the millions of women
who hopefully will watch this
will never have to answer it again.
It is: Why are black women dying
faster and at higher rates
than any other group of people in America
from preventable,
obesity-related diseases?




 3:07


The question hurts me.
I'm shaking a little bit.
It feels value-laden.
It hurts my body because the weight
represents so much.
But we're going to talk about it
and invite you into
an inside conversation today
because it is necessary,
and because we need you.




 3:25


VG: Each night,
before the first day of school,
my grandmother
would sit me next to the stove
and with expert precision
use a hot comb to press my hair.
My grandmother was legendary, big, loud.
She filled up a room with laughter
and oftentimes curse words.
She cooked a mean peach cobbler,
had 11 children,
a house full of grandchildren,
and like every black woman I know,
like most all women I know,
she had prioritized the care of others
over caring for herself.
We measured her strength by her capacity
to endure pain and suffering.
We celebrated her for it,
and our choice would prove to be deadly.
One night after pressing my hair
before the first day of eighth grade,
my grandmother went to bed
and never woke up,
dead at 66 years old from a heart attack.
By the time I would graduate college,
I would lose two more beloved
family members to chronic disease:
my aunt Diane, dead at 55,
my aunt Tricia, dead at 63.
After living with these losses,
the hole that they left,
I decided to calculate the life expectancy
of the women in my family.
Staring back at me, the number 65.
I knew I could not sit by
and watch another woman I loved
die an early death.




 4:37


TMD: So we don't usually
put our business in the streets.
Let's just put that out there.
But I have to tell you the statistics.
Black women are dying at alarming rates,
and I used to be a classroom teacher,
and I was at South Atlanta High School,
and I remember standing
in front of my classroom,
and I remember a statistic
that half of black girls will get diabetes
unless diet and levels of activity change.
Half of the girls in my classroom.
So I couldn't teach anymore.
So I started taking girls hiking,
which is why we're called GirlTrek,
but Vanessa was like,
that is not going to move the dial
on the health crisis; it's cute.
She was like, it's a cute hiking club.
So what we thought
is if we could rally
a million of their mothers ...
82 percent of black women
are over a healthy weight right now.
53 percent of us are obese.
But the number that I cannot,
that I cannot get out of my head
is that every single day in America,
137 black women
die from a preventable disease,
heart disease.
That's every 11 minutes.
137 is more than gun violence,
cigarette smoking and HIV combined,
every day.
It is roughly the amount of people
that were on my plane
from New Jersey to Vancouver.
Can you imagine that?
A plane filled with black women
crashing to the ground every day,
and no one is talking about it.




 6:05


VG: So the question that you're all
asking yourselves right now is why?
Why are black women dying?
We asked ourselves that same question.
Why is what's out there
not working for them?
Private weight loss companies,
government interventions,
public health campaigns.
I'm going to tell you why:
because they focus on weight loss
or looking good in skinny jeans
without acknowledging the trauma
that black women
hold in our bellies and bones,
that has been embedded in our very DNA.
The best advice
from hospitals and doctors,
the best medications
from pharmaceutical companies
to treat the congestive heart failure
of my grandmother didn't work
because they didn't acknowledge
the systemic racism
that she had dealt with since birth.




 6:43


(Applause)




 6:44


A divestment in schools,
discriminatory housing practices,
predatory lending,
a crack cocaine epidemic,
mass incarceration putting
more black bodies behind bars
than were owned at the height of slavery.




 6:56


But GirlTrek does.
For black women whose bodies
are buckling under the weight
of systems never designed to support them,
GirlTrek is a lifeline.
August 16, 2015, Danita Kimball,
a member of GirlTrek in Detroit,
received the news that too many
black mothers have received.
Her son Norman, 23 years old,
a father of two,
was gunned down
while on an afternoon drive.
Imagine the grief
that overcomes your body in that moment,
the immobilizing fear.
Now, know this, that just days
after laying her son to rest,
Danita Kimball posted online,
""I don't know what to do
or how to move forward,
but my sisters keep telling me
I need to walk, so I will.""
And then just days after that,
""I got my steps in today for my baby Norm.
It felt good to be out there, to walk.""




 7:47


TMD: Walking through pain
is what we have always done.
My mom, she's in the middle right there,
my mom desegregated
her high school in 1955.
Her mom walked down the steps
of an abandoned school bus
where she raised 11 kids
as a sharecropper.
And her mom stepped onto Indian territory
fleeing the terrors of the Jim Crow South.
And her mom walked her man to the door
as he went off to fight
in the Kentucky Colored Regiment,
the Civil War.
They were born slaves
but they wouldn't die slaves.
Change-making, it's in my blood.
It's what I do,
and this health crisis ain't nothing
compared to the road we have traveled.




 8:26


(Applause)




 8:31


So it's like James Cleveland.
I don't feel no ways tired,
so we got to work.
We started looking at models of change.
We looked all over the world.
We needed something
not only that was a part
of our cultural inheritance like walking,
but something that was scalable,
something that was high-impact,
something that we could replicate
across this country.
So we studied models like Wangari Maathai,
who won the Nobel Peace Prize
for inspiring women
to plant 50 million trees in Kenya.
She brought Kenya back from the brink
of environmental devastation.
We studied these systems of change,
and we looked at walking scientifically.
And what we learned
is that walking just 30 minutes a day
can single-handedly decrease
50 percent of your risk of diabetes,
heart disease, stroke,
even Alzheimer's and dementia.
We know that walking
is the single most powerful thing
that a woman can do for her health,
so we knew we were on to something,
because from Harriet Tubman
to the women in Montgomery,
when black women walk, things change.




 9:28


(Applause)




 9:29


VG: So how did we take
this simple idea of walking
and start a revolution
that would catch a fire
in neighborhoods across America?
We used the best practices
of the Civil Rights Movement.
We huddled up in church basements.
We did grapevine information sharing
through beauty salons.
We empowered and trained mothers
to stand on the front lines.
We took our message
directly to the streets,
and women responded.
Women like LaKeisha in Chattanooga,
Chrysantha in Detroit,
Onika in New Orleans,
women with difficult names
and difficult stories
join GirlTrek every day and commit
to walking as a practice of self-care.
Once walking, those women
get to organizing,
first their families,
then their communities,
to walk and talk
and solve problems together.
They walk and notice
the abandoned building.
They walk and notice
the lack of sidewalks,
the lack of green space,
and they say, ""No more.""
Women like Susie Paige in Philadelphia,
who after walking daily past
an abandoned building in her neighborhood,
decided, ""I'm not waiting.
Let me rally my team.
Let me grab some supplies.
Let me do what no one else has done
for me and my community.""




10:32


TMD: We know one woman
can make a difference,
because one woman
has already changed the world,
and her name is Harriet Tubman.
And trust me, I love Harriet Tubman.
I'm obsessed with her,
and I used to be a history teacher.
I will not tell you the whole history.
I will tell you four things.
So I used to have an old Saab 
the kind of canvas top that drips
on your head when it rains 
and I drove all the way down
to the eastern shore of Maryland,
and when I stepped on the dirt
that Harriet Tubman made her first escape,
I knew she was a woman just like we are
and that we could do what she had done,
and we learned four things
from Harriet Tubman.




11:05


The first one: do not wait.
Walk right now in the direction
of your healthiest, most fulfilled life,
because self-care is a revolutionary act.




11:16


Number two:
when you learn the way forward,
come back and get a sister.
So in our case,
start a team with your friends 
your friends, your family, your church.




11:24


Number three:
rally your allies.
Every single person in this room
is complicit in
a Tubman-inspired takeover.




11:36


And number four:
find joy.
The most underreported
fact of Harriet Tubman
is that she lived to be 93 years old,
and she didn't live
just an ordinary life; uh-uh.
She was standing up for the good guys.
She married a younger man.
She adopted a child.
I'm not kidding. She lived.
And I drove up to her house
of freedom in upstate New York,
and she had planted apple trees,
and when I was there on a Sunday,
they were blooming.
Do you call it  do they bloom?
The apples were in season,
and I was thinking, she left fruit for us,
the legacy of Harriet Tubman,
every single year.
And we know that we are Harriet,
and we know that there is a Harriet
in every community in America.




12:17


VG: We also know that there's a Harriet
in every community across the globe,
and that they could learn
from our Tubman Doctrine,
as we call it, the four steps.
Imagine the possibilities
beyond the neighborhoods
of Oakland and Newark,
to the women working
rice fields in Vietnam,
tea fields in Sri Lanka,
the women on the
mountainsides in Guatemala,
the indigenous reservations
throughout the vast plains of the Dakotas.
We believe that women walking
and talking together
to solve their problems
is a global solution.




12:47


TMD: And I'll leave you with this,
because we also believe it can become
the center of social justice again.
Vanessa and I were in Fort Lauderdale.
We had an organizer training,
and I was leaving
and I got on the airplane,
and I saw someone I knew, so I waved,
and as I'm waiting in that long line
that you guys know,
waiting for people
to put their stuff away,
I looked back and I realized I didn't
know the woman but I recognized her.
And so I blew her a kiss
because it was Sybrina Fulton,
Trayvon Martin's mom,
and she whispered ""thank you"" back to me.
And I can't help but wonder
what would happen
if there were groups of women
walking on Trayvon's block that day,
or what would happen
in the South Side of Chicago every day
if there were groups of women
and mothers and aunts and cousins
walking,
or along the polluted rivers
of Flint, Michigan.
I believe that walking
can transform our communities,
because it's already starting to.




13:41


VG: We believe that
the personal is political.
Our walking is for healing,
for joy, for fresh air,
quiet time, to connect
and disconnect, to worship.
But it's also walking
so we can be healthy enough
to stand on the front lines
for change in our communities,
and it is our call to action
to every black woman listening,
every black woman in earshot of our voice,
every black woman who you know.
Think about it: the woman working
front desk reception at your job,
the woman who delivers
your mail, your neighbor 
our call to action to them,
to join us on the front lines
for change in your community.




14:16


TMD: And I'll bring us back to this moment
and why it's so important
for my dear, dear friend Vanessa and I.
It's because it's not always easy for us,
and in fact, we have both seen
really, really dark days,
from the hate speech to the summer
of police brutality and violence
that we saw last year,
to even losing one of our walkers,
Sandy Bland, who died in police custody.
But the most courageous thing
we do every day is we practice faith
that goes beyond the facts,
and we put feet to our prayers
every single day,
and when we get overwhelmed,
we think of the words of people
like Sonia Sanchez, a poet laureate,
who says, ""Morgan, where is your fire?
Where is the fire that burned
holes through slave ships
to make us breathe?
Where is the fire
that turned guts into chitlins,
that took rhythms and make jazz,
that took sit-ins and marches
and made us jump boundaries and barriers?
You've got to find it and pass it on.""




15:11


So this is us finding our fire
and passing it on to you.
So please, stand with us,
walk with us as we rally a million women
to reclaim the streets
of the 50 highest need communities
in this country.




15:24


We thank you so much for this opportunity.




15:26

I want to share with you
something my father taught me:
no condition is permanent.
It's a lesson he shared with me
again and again,
and I learned it to be true the hard way.




 0:27


Here I am in my fourth-grade class.
This is my yearbook picture
taken in my class in school
in Monrovia, Liberia.
My parents migrated from India
to West Africa in the 1970s,
and I had the privilege
of growing up there.
I was nine years old,
I loved kicking around a soccer ball,
and I was a total math and science geek.
I was living the kind of life
that, really, any child would dream of.
But no condition is permanent.




 0:59


On Christmas Eve in 1989,
civil war erupted in Liberia.
The war started in the rural countryside,
and within months, rebel armies
had marched towards our hometown.
My school shut down,
and when the rebel armies captured
the only international airport,
people started panicking and fleeing.
My mom came knocking one morning
and said, ""Raj, pack your things 
we have to go.""
We were rushed to the center of town,
and there on a tarmac,
we were split into two lines.
I stood with my family in one line,
and we were stuffed into the cargo hatch
of a rescue plane.
And there on a bench,
I was sitting with my heart racing.
As I looked out the open hatch,
I saw hundreds of Liberians
in another line,
children strapped to their backs.
When they tried to jump in with us,
I watched soldiers restrain them.
They were not allowed to flee.




 2:00


We were the lucky ones.
We lost what we had,
but we resettled in America,
and as immigrants, we benefitted
from the community of supporters
that rallied around us.
They took my family into their home,
they mentored me.
And they helped my dad
start a clothing shop.
I'd visit my father
on weekends as a teenager
to help him sell sneakers and jeans.
And every time business would get bad,
he'd remind me of that mantra:
no condition is permanent.
That mantra and my parents' persistence
and that community of supporters
made it possible for me
to go through college
and eventually to medical school.
I'd once had my hopes crushed in a war,
but because of them,
I had a chance to pursue my dream
to become a doctor.
My condition had changed.




 2:53


It had been 15 years
since I escaped that airfield,
but the memory of those two lines
had not escaped my mind.
I was a medical student in my mid-20s,
and I wanted to go back
to see if I could serve
the people we'd left behind.
But when I got back,
what I found was utter destruction.
The war had left us with just 51 doctors
to serve a country of four million people.
It would be like the city of San Francisco
having just 10 doctors.
So if you got sick in the city
where those few doctors remain,
you might stand a chance.
But if you got sick in the remote,
rural rainforest communities,
where you could be days
from the nearest clinic 
I was seeing my patients die
from conditions no one should die from,
all because they were
getting to me too late.
Imagine you have a two-year-old
who wakes up one morning with a fever,
and you realize she could have malaria,
and you know the only way to get her
the medicine she needs
would be to take her to the riverbed,
get in a canoe, paddle to the other side
and then walk for up to two days
through the forest
just to reach the nearest clinic.




 3:53


One billion people live
in the world's most remote communities,
and despite the advances we've made
in modern medicine and technology,
our innovations are not
reaching the last mile.
These communities have been left behind,
because they've been thought
too hard to reach
and too difficult to serve.
Illness is universal;
access to care is not.
And realizing this lit a fire in my soul.
No one should die because they live
too far from a doctor or clinic.
No condition should be permanent.
And help in this case
didn't come from the outside,
it actually came from within.
It came from the communities themselves.




 4:31


Meet Musu.
Way out in rural Liberia,
where most girls have not had
a chance to finish primary school,
Musu had been persistent.
At the age of 18,
she completed high school,
and she came back to her community.
She saw that none of the children
were getting treatment
for the diseases
they needed treatment for 
deadly diseases, like malaria
and pneumonia.
So she signed up to be a volunteer.
There are millions of volunteers like Musu
in rural parts around our world,
and we got to thinking 
community members like Musu
could actually help us solve a puzzle.




 5:07


Our health care system
is structured in such a way
that the work of diagnosing disease
and prescribing medicines
is limited to a team of nurses
and doctors like me.
But nurses and doctors
are concentrated in cities,
so rural communities like Musu's
have been left behind.




 5:23


So we started asking some questions:
What if we could reorganize
the medical care system?
What if we could have community
members like Musu
be a part or even be the center
of our medical team?
What if Musu could help us bring
health care from clinics in cities
to the doorsteps of her neighbors?
Musu was 48 when I met her.
And despite her amazing talent and grit,
she hadn't had a paying job in 30 years.
So what if technology could support her?
What if we could invest in her
with real training,
equip her with real medicines,
and have her have a real job?




 6:07


Well, in 2007, I was trying
to answer these questions,
and my wife and I were
getting married that year.
We asked our relatives to forgo
the wedding registry gifts
and instead donate some money
so we could have some start-up money
to launch a nonprofit.
I promise you, I'm a lot
more romantic than that.




 6:27


(Laughter)




 6:29


We ended up raising $6,000,
teamed up with some
Liberians and Americans
and launched a nonprofit
called Last Mile Health.
Our goal is to bring a health worker
within reach of everyone, everywhere.
We designed a three-step process 
train, equip and pay 
to invest more deeply
in volunteers like Musu
to become paraprofessionals,
to become community health workers.




 6:52


First we trained Musu to prevent,
diagnose and treat
the top 10 diseases afflicting
families in her village.
A nurse supervisor visited her
every month to coach her.
We equipped her with modern
medical technology,
like this $1 malaria rapid test,
and put it in a backpack
full of medicines like this
to treat infections like pneumonia,
and crucially,
a smartphone, to help her track
and report on epidemics.
Last, we recognized
the dignity in Musu's work.
With the Liberian government,
we created a contract,
paid her
and gave her the chance
to have a real job.
And she's amazing.




 7:34


Musu has learned over 30 medical skills,
from screening children for malnutrition,
to assessing the cause
of a child's cough with a smartphone,
to supporting people with HIV
and providing follow-up care
to patients who've lost their limbs.
Working as part of our team,
working as paraprofessionals,
community health workers can help ensure
that a lot of what
your family doctor would do
reaches the places that most
family doctors could never go.




 8:05


One of my favorite things to do
is to care for patients
with community health workers.
So last year I was visiting A.B.,
and like Musu, A.B. had had
a chance to go to school.
He was in middle school,
in the eighth grade,
when his parents died.
He became an orphan and had to drop out.
Last year, we hired and trained
A.B. as a community health worker.
And while he was making
door to door house calls,
he met this young boy named Prince,
whose mother had had trouble
breastfeeding him,
and by the age of six months,
Prince had started to waste away.
A.B. had just been taught how to use
this color-coded measuring tape
that wraps around the upper arm
of a child to diagnose malnutrition.
A.B. noticed that Prince
was in the red zone,
which meant he had to be hospitalized.




 8:52


So A.B. took Prince
and his mother to the river,
got in a canoe
and paddled for four hours
to get to the hospital.
Later, after Prince was discharged,
A.B. taught mom how to feed baby
a food supplement.
A few months ago,
A.B. took me to visit Prince,
and he's a chubby little guy.




 9:12


(Laughter)




 9:13


He's meeting his milestones,
he's pulled himself up to a stand,
and is even starting to say a few words.
I'm so inspired by these
community health workers.
I often ask them why they do what they do,
and when I asked A.B.,
he said, ""Doc, since I dropped out
of school, this is the first time
I'm having a chance
to hold a pen to write.
My brain is getting fresh.""




 9:37


The stories of A.B. and Musu
have taught me something fundamental
about being human.
Our will to serve others
can actually help us
transform our own conditions.
I was so moved by how powerful
the will to serve our neighbors can be
a few years ago,
when we faced a global catastrophe.




 9:59


In December 2013,
something happened in the rainforests
across the border from us in Guinea.
A toddler named Emile fell sick
with vomiting, fever and diarrhea.
He lived in an area
where the roads were sparse
and there had been massive
shortages of health workers.
Emile died,
and a few weeks later his sister died,
and a few weeks later his mother died.
And this disease would spread
from one community to another.
And it wasn't until three months later
that the world recognized this as Ebola.
When every minute counted,
we had already lost months,
and by then the virus had spread
like wildfire all across West Africa,
and eventually to other
parts of the world.
Businesses shut down,
airlines started canceling routes.




10:40


At the height of the crisis,
when we were told that 1.4 million
people could be infected,
when we were told
that most of them would die,
when we had nearly lost all hope,
I remember standing with a group
of health workers
in the rainforest where
an outbreak had just happened.
We were helping train and equip
them to put on the masks,
the gloves and the gowns that they needed
to keep themselves safe from the virus
while they were serving their patients.
I remember the fear in their eyes.
And I remember staying up at night,
terrified if I'd made the right call
to keep them in the field.




11:21


When Ebola threatened to bring
humanity to its knees,
Liberia's community health workers
didn't surrender to fear.
They did what they had always done:
they answered the call
to serve their neighbors.
Community members across Liberia
learned the symptoms of Ebola,
teamed up with nurses and doctors
to go door-to-door to find the sick
and get them into care.
They tracked thousands of people
who had been exposed to the virus
and helped break
the chain of transmission.
Some ten thousand community
health workers risked their own lives
to help hunt down this virus
and stop it in its tracks.




11:58


(Applause)




12:05


Today, Ebola has come
under control in West Africa,
and we've learned a few things.
We've learned that blind spots
in rural health care
can lead to hot spots of disease,
and that places all of us at greater risk.
We've learned that the most efficient
emergency system
is actually an everyday system,
and that system has to reach
all communities,
including rural communities like Emile's.
And most of all,
we've learned from the courage
of Liberia's community health workers
that we as people are not defined
by the conditions we face,
no matter how hopeless they seem.
We're defined by how we respond to them.




12:45


For the past 15 years,
I've seen the power of this idea
to transform everyday citizens
into community health workers 
into everyday heroes.
And I've seen it play out everywhere,
from the forest communities
of West Africa,
to the rural fishing villages of Alaska.
It's true,
these community health workers
aren't doing neurosurgery,
but they're making it possible
to bring health care within reach
of everyone everywhere.




13:14


So now what?
Well, we know that there are still
millions of people dying
from preventable causes
in rural communities around the world.
And we know that the great majority
of these deaths are happening
in these 75 blue-shaded countries.
What we also know
is that if we trained an army
of community health workers
to learn even just 30 lifesaving skills,
we could save the lives of nearly
30 million people by 2030.
Thirty services could save
30 million lives by 2030.
That's not just a blueprint 
we're proving this can be done.




13:52


In Liberia,
the Liberian government is training
thousands of workers like A.B. and Musu
after Ebola,
to bring health care to every
child and family in the country.
And we've been honored to work with them,
and are now teaming up
with a number of organizations
that are working across other countries
to try to help them do the same thing.
If we could help these countries scale,
we could save millions of lives,
and at the same time,
we could create millions of jobs.




14:22


We simply can't do that, though,
without technology.
People are worried that technology
is going to steal our jobs,
but when it comes
to community health workers,
technology has actually
been vital for creating jobs.
Without technology 
without this smartphone,
without this rapid test 
it would have been impossible for us
to be able to employ A.B. and Musu.
And I think it's time
for technology to help us train,
to help us train people faster
and better than ever before.




14:53


As a doctor,
I use technology to stay up-to-date
and keep certified.
I use smartphones, I use apps,
I use online courses.
But when A.B. wants to learn,
he's got to jump back in that canoe
and get to the training center.
And when Musu shows up for training,
her instructors are stuck using
flip charts and markers.
Why shouldn't they have the same
access to learn as I do?
If we truly want community health workers
to master those lifesaving skills
and even more,
we've got to change this old-school
model of education.
Tech can truly be a game changer here.
I've been in awe of the digital
education revolution
that the likes of Khan Academy
and edX have been leading.
And I've been thinking that it's time;
it's time for a collision
between the digital education revolution
and the community health revolution.




15:50


And so, this brings me
to my TED Prize wish.
I wish 
I wish that you would help us recruit
the largest army of community health
workers the world has ever known
by creating the Community Health Academy,
a global platform to train,
connect and empower.




16:09


(Applause)




16:10


Thank you.




16:12


(Applause)




16:15


Thank you.




16:18


Here's the idea:
we'll create and curate
the best in digital education resources.
We will bring those to community
health workers around the world,
including A.B. and Musu.
They'll get video lessons
on giving kids vaccines
and have online courses
on spotting the next outbreak,
so they're not stuck using flip charts.
We'll help these countries
accredit these workers,
so that they're not stuck remaining
an under-recognized, undervalued group,
but become a renowned,
empowered profession,
just like nurses and doctors.




16:56


And we'll create a network
of companies and entrepreneurs
who've created innovations
that can save lives
and help them connect
to workers like Musu,
so she can help better
serve her community.
And we'll work tirelessly
to persuade governments
to make community health workers
a cornerstone of their health care plans.
We plan to test and prototype
the academy in Liberia
and a few other partner countries,
and then we plan to take it global,
including to rural North America.
With the power of this platform,
we believe countries can be more persuaded
that a health care revolution
really is possible.




17:35


My dream is that this academy
will contribute to the training
of hundreds of thousands
of community members
to help bring health care
to their neighbors 
the hundreds of millions of them
that live in the world's most
remote communities,
from the forest communities
of West Africa,
to the fishing villages of rural Alaska;
from the hilltops of Appalachia,
to the mountains of Afghanistan.
If this vision is aligned with yours,
head to communityhealthacademy.org,
and join this revolution.
Let us know if you or your organization
or someone you know could help us
as we try to build this academy
over the next year.




18:16


Now, as I look out into this room,
I realize that our journeys
are not self-made;
they're shaped by others.
And there have been so many here
that have been part of this cause.
We're so honored to be part
of this community,
and a community that's willing
to take on a cause
as audacious as this one,
so I wanted to offer, as I end,
a reflection.




18:38


I think a lot more about
what my father taught me.
These days, I too have become a dad.
I have two sons,
and my wife and I just learned
that she's pregnant with our third child.




18:51


(Applause)




18:52


Thank you.




18:53


(Applause)




18:55


I was recently caring
for a woman in Liberia
who, like my wife,
was in her third pregnancy.
But unlike my wife,
had had no prenatal care
with her first two babies.
She lived in an isolated community
in the forest that had gone for 100 years
without any health care
until ...
until last year when a nurse
trained her neighbors
to become community health workers.




19:22


So here I was,
seeing this patient
who was in her second trimester,
and I pulled out the ultrasound
to check on the baby,
and she started telling us stories
about her first two kids,
and I had the ultrasound
probe on her belly,
and she just stopped mid-sentence.
She turned to me and she said,
""Doc, what's that sound?""
It was the first time she'd ever heard
her baby's heartbeat.
And her eyes lit up in the same way
my wife's eyes and my own eyes lit up
when we heard our baby's heartbeat.




20:02


For all of human history,
illness has been universal
and access to care has not.
But as a wise man once told me:
no condition is permanent.
It's time.
It's time for us to go as far as it takes
to change this condition together.




20:22


Thank you.




20:23

Silicon Valley
is obsessed with disruption,
but these days, the biggest disruptor
didn't come out of Silicon Valley.
It came out of steel towns in Ohio,
rural communities in Pennsylvania,
the Panhandle in Florida.
And this last US presidential election
was the mother of all disruptions.
Once again, politics is personal.
Millions of Americans
became activists overnight,
pouring into the streets in record numbers
in record time.




 0:47


(Laughter)




 0:49


The election has done
to family holiday dinners
what Uber has done
to New York City's taxi system.
Couples have broken up
and marriages disrupted.
And the election
is doing to my private life
what Amazon is doing to shopping malls.
These days, the ACLU
is on the front lines 24/7,
and even if I manage to sneak away
for a couple of miles on the treadmill,
any cardio benefit I get
is instantly obliterated
when I read another presidential tweet
on the headline scroll.
Even my secret pleasure
of studying the Italian painters
have been infected by politics.




 1:33


Now, I study, even stalk, the old masters.
This is my desk,
with a postcard exhibition
of some famous and obscure paintings
mostly from the Italian Renaissance.
Now, art used to provide me
with a necessary break
from the hurly-burly of politics
in my daily work at the ACLU,
but not anymore.




 1:54


I was at the Women's March
in San Francisco
the day after inauguration,
and the crowd was chanting,
""This is what democracy looks like.""
""This is what democracy looks like.""
And there I was holding my sign
and my umbrella in the rain,
and I flashed on an old painting
that first captivated me many years ago.
I struggled to remember
the different pieces
of an actual painting
of good and bad government.
It was almost like the old master
was taunting me.
You want to know
what democracy looks like?
Go back and look at my frescoes.




 2:32


And so I did.
In 1339, Ambrogio Lorenzetti
finished a monumental commission
in the governing council chamber
of Siena's Palazzo Pubblico.
It's a painting that speaks to us,
even screams to us, today.
""Art is a lie that makes us
realize truth,""
Pablo Picasso once said.
And as we search for the truth
about government,
we should keep Ambrogio's work,
not a lie but an allegory,
in our collective mind's eye.




 3:07


During Lorenzetti's time,
the political legitimacy
of Italian city-states
was often on very shaky ground.
Siena was a republic,
but there had been enormous unrest
in the two decades
leading up to the commission.
Siena's political leaders,
who would literally govern
under the eyes
of these allegorical figures,
were Lorenzetti's intended audience.
He was cataloging the obligations
of the governing to the governed.




 3:37


Now, you can spend years
studying these frescoes.
Some scholars have.
I'm hardly an art historian,
but I am passionate about art,
and a work this massive can overwhelm me.
So first, I focus on the big stuff.




 3:54


This is the allegory of good government.
The majestic figure here in the middle
is dressed in Siena's colors
and he personifies the republic itself.
Lorenzetti labels him ""Commune,""
and he's basically telling the Sienese
that they, and not a king or a tyrant,
must rule themselves.
Now, surrounding Commune are his advisors.
Justice is enthroned.
She's looking up at the figure of wisdom,
who actually supports
her scales of justice.
Concord, or Harmony,
holds a string that comes
off the scales of justice
that binds her to the citizens,
making them all
compatriots in the republic.
And finally we see Peace.
She looks chilled out,
like she's listening to Bob Marley.
When good government rules,
Peace doesn't break a sweat.




 4:59


Now, these are big images and big ideas,
but I really love the small stuff.
Along another wall,
Lorenzetti illustrates
the effects of good government
on the real and everyday lives
of ordinary people
with a series of delicious little details.
In the countryside,
the hills are landscaped and farmed.
Crops are being sown,
hoed, reaped, milled, plowed,
all in one picture.
Crops and livestock
are being brought to market.
In the city, builders raise a tower.
People attend a law lecture,
a TED Talk of the 14th century.




 5:43


(Laughter)




 5:46


Schoolchildren play.
Tradesmen thrive.
Dancers larger than life dance with joy.
And watching over the republic
is the winged figure Security,
whose banner reads,
""Everyone shall go forth
freely without fear.""




 6:10


Now, what's amazing
about these images from 800 years ago
is that they're familiar to us today.
We see what democracy looks like.
We experience the effects
of good government in our lives,
just as Lorenzetti did in his life.




 6:25


But it is the allegory of bad government
that has been haunting me
since November 9.
It's badly damaged,
but it reads like today's newspapers.
And ruling over bad government
is not the Commune
but the Tyrant.
He has horns, tusks, crossed eyes,
braided hair.
He obviously spends
a lot of time on that hair.




 6:48


(Laughter)




 6:49


Justice now lies helpless at his feet,
shackled.
Her scales have been severed.
Justice is the key antagonist
to the Tyrant,
and she's been taken out.




 7:03


Now, surrounding the Tyrant,
Lorenzetti illustrates
the vices that animate bad government.
Avarice is the old woman
clutching the strongbox
and a fisherman's hook
to pull in her fortune.
Vainglory carries a mirror,
and Lorenzetti warns us
against narcissistic leaders
who are guided
by their own ego and vanity.
On the Tyrant's right is Cruelty.
Treason, half lamb, half scorpion,
lulls us into a false sense of security
and then poisons a republic.
Fraud, with the flighty wings of a bat.
On the Tyrant's left, you see Division.
She's dressed in Siena's colors.
""Si"" and ""No"" are painted on her body.
She uses a carpenter's saw
to chop her body in half.
And Fury wields the weapons of the mob,
the stone and knife.




 8:22


In the remainder of the fresco,
Lorenzetti shows us
the inevitable effects of bad government.
The civic ideals celebrated
elsewhere in this room have failed us,
and we see it.
The once beautiful city
has fallen to pieces,
the countryside barren,
the farms abandoned.
Many are in flames.
And in the sky above
is not the winged figure Security,
but that of Fear, whose banner reads:
""None shall pass along this road
without fear of death.""




 8:56


Now, the final image,
the most important one, really,
is one that Lorenzetti did not paint.
It is of the viewer.
Today, the audience
for Lorenzetti's frescoes
is not the governing but the governed,
the individual who stands
in front of his allegories
and walks away with insight,
who heeds a call to action.
Lorenzetti warns us
that we must recognize the shadows
of Avarice, Fraud, Division, even Tyranny
when they float
across our political landscape,
especially when those shadows are cast
by political leaders loudly claiming
to be the voice of good government
and promising to make America great again.




 9:37


And we must act.
Democracy must not be a spectator sport.
The right to protest,
the right to assemble freely,
the right to petition one's government,
these are not just rights.
In the face of Avarice,
Fraud and Division,
these are obligations.
We have to disrupt 




 9:55


(Applause)




10:00


We have to disrupt our lives
so that we can disrupt
the amoral accretion of power
by those who would betray our values.
We and we the people
must raise justice up
and must bring peace to our nation
and must come together in concord,
and we have a choice.
We could either paint ourselves
into the worst nightmare
of Lorenzetti's bad government,
or we can stay in the streets,
disruptive, messy, loud.
That is what democracy looks like.




10:38


Thank you.




10:39


(Applause)




10:50


Chris Anderson: First of all, wow.
Obviously, many people passionately 
you spoke to many people
passionately here.
I'm sure there are other people here
who'd say, look, Trump was elected
by 63 million people.
He's far from perfect,
but he's trying to do
what he was elected to do.
Shouldn't you give him a chance?




11:09


Anthony Romero:
I think we have to recognize
the legitimacy of him as president
versus the legitimacy of his policies.
And when so many of the policies
are contrary to fundamental values,
that we're all equal under the law,
that we're not judged by the color
of our skin or the religion we worship,
we have to contest those values
even as we recognize and honor the fact
that our democracy rendered us a president
who is championing those values.




11:39


CA: And the ACLU isn't just
this force on the left, right?
You're making other arguments as well.




11:45


AR: Well, you know,
very often we piss
everyone off at one point.
That's what we do.
And we recently were taking stands
for why Ann Coulter needs
to be able to speak at Berkeley,
and why Milo has free speech rights.
And we even wrote a blog
that almost burnt the house down
among some of our members,
unfortunately,
when we talked about the fact
that even Donald Trump
has free speech rights as president,
and an effort to hold him accountable
for incitement of violence
at his marches or his rallies
is unconstitutional and un-American.
And when you put that statement out there
to a very frothy base
that always is very excited for you
to fight Donald Trump,
and then you have a new one saying,
""Wait, these rights are for everybody,
even the president that we don't like.""
And that's our job.




12:35


(Applause)




12:38


CA: Anthony, you spoke
to so many of us so powerfully.




12:41


Thank you so much. Thank you.

Damian Kulash:
Thank you, thanks very much.




 3:53


We are OK Go,
and we've been together
as a band since 1998.
But in the last decade,
we've become known as much
for the elaborate music videos,
like the one we just saw,
as for the songs they accompany.
So we will play along with another
one of those in a few minutes,
but in the meantime,
we want to address this question
that we get asked all the time
but we've really never come up
with an adequate answer for it,
and that is, how do we
think of those ideas?




 4:22


The videos are not all
Rube Goldberg machines, by the way.
Last year we did a dance in zero gravity,
and once we set up an obstacle course
out of thousands of musical
instruments in the desert,
and then played them
by stunt driving a car through them.




 4:36


(Laughter)




 4:37


For one of the videos,
we choreographed
hundreds of people with umbrellas
in an abandoned parking lot outside Tokyo,
and then filmed them from a drone
a half a mile in the air.




 4:47


So it's all of these ideas
that people are curious about,
and the reason we've had so much trouble
describing how we think of these ideas
is that it doesn't really feel
like we think of them at all.
It feels like we find them.
And by way of explanation 
well, I have a compulsive habit.
I play parallax and perspective games
with my eyes pretty much all the time,
and it's something I've been doing
since I was a teenager.
And I think the big contributing
factor may have been
that this is how I decorated
my high school bedroom.




 5:21


(Laughter)




 5:22


And being a teenager,
what I did in there, of course,
was just talk on the phone
for staggering amounts of time.
So I was in this visual maelstrom
just pretty much
usually sitting in one place,
and I guess just
the overload in general 
my brain kind of tried
to make sense of it, and I would 
If I could move my head off
to one side a little bit,
the edge of the desk
would line up just perfectly
with that poster on the opposite wall;
or if I put my thumb out,
I could close first my left eye
and then my right,
and my thumb would bounce back and forth
between Jimi Hendrix's
left eye and his right.




 5:55


(Laughter)




 5:56


It was not a conscious thing, of course,
this is just kind of the equivalent
of doodling while you're talking,
and it's still something
I do all the time.
This is my wife, Kristin 




 6:05


(Applause)




 6:06


Yeah!
Woo!




 6:10


And it's not uncommon
that we are out at dinner,
and in the middle of a great conversation
she'll just stop mid-sentence,
and when she stops is when I realize
that I'm the one who's acting weird
because I'm like bobbing and weaving.
And what I'm trying to do
is get that ficus back there
to stick out of her head like a ponytail.




 6:27


(Laughter)




 6:29


The point of telling you
all this is that 
for me this is what it feels like
to have an idea.
It's like they're made
of these disparate parts,
these disparate chunks
sort of floating out there.
And if you're receptive
and you're observant,
and crucially, if you're
in exactly the right place,
you can get them to just line up.




 6:49


So if you get used to 
if it's your job
to think of ideas this way,
they'll start beckoning to you
the way that Jimi's eyes
beckoned from that poster,
or the ficus beckons
from behind Kristin's head.
Writing music feels like that process
just over and over again,
like you've got a bunch of sounds
or a groove or a chord progression
and you're just looking
for that thing on the other side,
that little chunk over there,
that puzzle piece that clicks right in.
And when it does click,
it doesn't feel like you
thought up that puzzle piece,
it feels like you found it 
like it was a set of relationships
that you unlocked.




 7:24


But with the videos in particular,
we're usually looking
for this specific feeling
which is wonder.
And there's always a component
of surprise to wonder,
so we're not just looking for good ideas,
we're looking for good ideas
that surprise us in some way.
And this causes something of a problem,
because ...
the process that we all use to make stuff,
it actually has a very strong bias
against surprising ideas.




 7:50


The process I'm talking about
is the one you all know 
we all do it all the time.
You think of an idea.
You just sit and think
of your brilliant idea
and then you come up with a plan
for how you're going to make
that idea happen.
And then with that plan in mind,
you go back and double-check
your original idea
and maybe revise it,
and then bouncing back and forth
between the idea and the plan,
the plan and the idea,
eventually you come up
with a truly great plan.
And then once you have that,
and only then,
do you go out and you execute.
And this is like 
this is sort of a flawless system
in terms of maximizing your resources,
because this  super cheap.
Thinking usually costs very little,
but this is really expensive
most of the time,
so by the time you get there,
you want to make sure
you're super prepared
and you can squeeze every last drop
out of what you've got.




 8:36


But there are problems with this,
and math will help us
reveal the biggest one.
Go back to that video
that we just showed you.
That Rube Goldberg machine,
it had about 130 interactions in it.
That was 130 things
that we had to have go
according to our plan.
So let's assume that we want
to make a new video now,
similarly complex  130 moving parts.
If we're really good planners
in that system,
it seems like maybe
we could be good enough
to get every part of that system
to be 90 percent reliable.
90 percent sounds good, right?
Well, it's not.
It's terrible actually.
The numbers say so.
The chance of getting all 130 things
to not fail at the same time
is .9 for 90 percent to the 130th power.
So calculate that out and you get ...




 9:27


(Ding)




 9:28


.000001,
which is one ten-thousandth
of one percent,
so your chance for success
is literally one in a million.




 9:40


(Whistle)




 9:42


(Laughter)




 9:44


I mean that's not a gamble I want to take,
so let's ratchet up
that reliability to 99 percent.
.99 to the 130th power is ...




 9:53


(Ding)




 9:54


.27  27 percent.
Significantly less daunting 
like this might even be usable.
But really think about that.
How many parts of your lives
are 99 percent reliable?
And could you really get 130 of them
all in one place at once?
And if you really could,
doesn't it seem
like you deserve to succeed?
Like that is 
that thing is going to work, right?
But no, it actually fails three times
more often than it succeeds.




10:21


So the upshot of all this
is that if your project
is pretty complex 
like, you know,
every ambitious project is 
if you've got a lot of moving parts,
you're basically constrained
to just reshuffling ideas
that have already demonstrably
proven that they're 100 percent reliable.
So now go back to me sitting
with my thumb in the air
trying to line up something surprising.
If the only things I'm allowed
to consider in the first place
are ideas that have already been done
over and over and over again,
I am screwed.
However, there are ways around this,
because we all know that there are
tons of untried ideas still out there,
and plenty of them will turn out
to be every bit as reliable as we need,
it's just that we don't yet know
they are reliable
when we are at this planning phase.




11:09


So what we do is we try
to identify some place
where there might just be
a ton of those untried ideas.
We try to find a sandbox
and then we gamble
a whole bunch of our resources
on getting in that sandbox and playing.




11:23


(Laughter)




11:25


Because we have to trust
that it's the process in the sandbox
that will reveal to us
which ideas are not only surprising,
but surprisingly reliable.




11:34


So some of the sandboxes
that we've started videos with.
Let's play with optical illusions.
Let's try to dance on moving surfaces.
Let's try to make toast
with a laser cutter.
Or let's do something in one
of those zero-gravity airplanes.
But then instead
of actually trying to sit there
and think out what that something is,
we spent a full third of our budget
getting in an actual Vomit Comet
and bouncing off the walls for a week.




12:03


So this may seem to you like testing,
but it really isn't,
because at this point
we don't yet know what our idea is,
we don't have a plan to be testing.
So we're just 
we're just playing,
we're just trying everything
we can think of,
because we need to get this idea space
filled up with a chaos
like the one in my high school bedroom.
Because then, if we can
do the bob and weave thing,
if we can put our thumbs up
and get just a few things to line up 




12:32


(Ding)




12:33


chances are no one else has ever made
those same things line up before.
And when we're done with that project,
people will ask us again
how we thought of that idea,
and we'll be stumped,
because from our perspective,
it doesn't feel like
we thought of it at all,
it just feels like we found it.




12:48


So we'll play another video for you now
and the song along with it.
This is for the song ""The One Moment,""
and for this one,
the sandbox was ballistics and math.
So I spent a full month putting together
a giant spreadsheet for this.
It was like my playspace
was 400 lines long
and 25 columns wide 
which I presume that if anybody is going
to understand that, it's this crowd.




13:13


(Laughter)




13:14


Nothing is better
than a giant spreadsheet, right?




13:16


(Laughter)




13:18


Well, thank you everyone, very much.

So, imagine that you had
your smartphone miniaturized
and hooked up directly to your brain.
If you had this sort of brain chip,
you'd be able to upload
and download to the internet
at the speed of thought.
Accessing social media or Wikipedia
would be a lot like 
well, from the inside at least 
like consulting your own memory.
It would be as easy
and as intimate as thinking.
But would it make it easier
for you to know what's true?
Just because a way
of accessing information is faster
it doesn't mean it's more
reliable, of course,
and it doesn't mean that we would all
interpret it the same way.
And it doesn't mean that you would be
any better at evaluating it.
In fact, you might even be worse,
because, you know, more data,
less time for evaluation.




 0:57


Something like this is already
happening to us right now.
We already carry a world of information
around in our pockets,
but it seems as if the more information
we share and access online,
the more difficult it can be for us
to tell the difference
between what's real and what's fake.
It's as if we know more
but understand less.




 1:19


Now, it's a feature
of modern life, I suppose,
that large swaths of the public
live in isolated information bubbles.
We're polarized: not just over values,
but over the facts.
One reason for that is, the data
analytics that drive the internet
get us not just more information,
but more of the information that we want.
Our online life is personalized;
everything from the ads we read
to the news that comes down
our Facebook feed
is tailored to satisfy our preferences.
And so while we get more information,
a lot of that information ends up
reflecting ourselves
as much as it does reality.
It ends up, I suppose,
inflating our bubbles
rather than bursting them.
And so maybe it's no surprise
that we're in a situation,
a paradoxical situation,
of thinking that we know so much more,
and yet not agreeing
on what it is we know.




 2:16


So how are we going to solve
this problem of knowledge polarization?
One obvious tactic is to try
to fix our technology,
to redesign our digital platforms,
so as to make them less
susceptible to polarization.
And I'm happy to report
that many smart people at Google
and Facebook are working on just that.
And these projects are vital.
I think that fixing technology
is obviously really important,
but I don't think technology alone,
fixing it, is going to solve the problem
of knowledge polarization.
I don't think that because I don't think,
at the end of the day,
it is a technological problem.
I think it's a human problem,
having to do with how we think
and what we value.




 2:59


In order to solve it, I think
we're going to need help.
We're going to need help
from psychology and political science.
But we're also going to need help,
I think, from philosophy.
Because to solve the problem
of knowledge polarization,
we're going to need to reconnect
with one fundamental, philosophical idea:
that we live in a common reality.
The idea of a common reality
is like, I suppose,
a lot of philosophical concepts:
easy to state
but mysteriously difficult
to put into practice.
To really accept it,
I think we need to do three things,
each of which is a challenge right now.




 3:43


First, we need to believe in truth.
You might have noticed
that our culture is having
something of a troubled relationship
with that concept right now.
It seems as if we disagree so much that,
as one political commentator
put it not long ago,
it's as if there are no facts anymore.
But that thought is actually an expression
of a sort of seductive line
of argument that's in the air.
It goes like this:
we just can't step outside
of our own perspectives;
we can't step outside of our biases.
Every time we try,
we just get more information
from our perspective.
So, this line of thought goes,
we might as well admit
that objective truth is an illusion,
or it doesn't matter,
because either we'll never
know what it is,
or it doesn't exist in the first place.




 4:42


That's not a new philosophical thought 
skepticism about truth.
During the end of the last century,
as some of you know,
it was very popular in certain
academic circles.
But it really goes back all the way
to the Greek philosopher Protagoras,
if not farther back.
Protagoras said that objective
truth was an illusion
because ""man is the measure
of all things.""
Man is the measure of all things.
That can seem like a bracing bit
of realpolitik to people,
or liberating,
because it allows each of us
to discover or make our own truth.




 5:19


But actually, I think it's a bit
of self-serving rationalization
disguised as philosophy.
It confuses the difficulty
of being certain
with the impossibility of truth.
Look 
of course it's difficult
to be certain about anything;
we might all be living in ""The Matrix.""
You might have a brain chip in your head
feeding you all the wrong information.
But in practice, we do agree
on all sorts of facts.
We agree that bullets can kill people.
We agree that you can't flap
your arms and fly.
We agree  or we should 
that there is an external reality
and ignoring it can get you hurt.




 6:10


Nonetheless, skepticism
about truth can be tempting,
because it allows us to rationalize
away our own biases.
When we do that, we're sort of like
the guy in the movie
who knew he was living in ""The Matrix""
but decided he liked it there, anyway.
After all, getting what you
want feels good.
Being right all the time feels good.
So, often it's easier for us
to wrap ourselves in our cozy
information bubbles,
live in bad faith,
and take those bubbles
as the measure of reality.




 6:47


An example, I think, of how
this bad faith gets into our action
is our reaction
to the phenomenon of fake news.
The fake news that spread on the internet
during the American
presidential election of 2016
was designed to feed into our biases,
designed to inflate our bubbles.
But what was really striking about it
was not just that it fooled
so many people.
What was really striking to me
about fake news,
the phenomenon,
is how quickly it itself became
the subject of knowledge polarization;
so much so, that the very term 
the very term  ""fake news""
now just means: ""news story I don't like.""
That's an example of the bad faith
towards the truth that I'm talking about.




 7:42


But the really, I think, dangerous thing
about skepticism with regard to truth
is that it leads to despotism.
""Man is the measure of all things""
inevitably becomes ""The Man
is the measure of all things.""
Just as ""every man for himself""
always seems to turn out to be
""only the strong survive.""




 8:07


At the end of Orwell's ""1984,""
the thought policeman O'Brien is torturing
the protagonist Winston Smith
into believing two plus two equals five.
What O'Brien says is the point,
is that he wants to convince Smith
that whatever the party says is the truth,
and the truth is whatever the party says.
And what O'Brien knows
is that once this thought is accepted,
critical dissent is impossible.
You can't speak truth to power
if the power speaks truth by definition.




 8:47


I said that in order to accept
that we really live in a common reality,
we have to do three things.
The first thing is to believe in truth.
The second thing can be summed up
by the Latin phrase that Kant took
as the motto for the Enlightenment:
""Sapere aude,""
or ""dare to know.""
Or as Kant wants,
""to dare to know for yourself.""




 9:09


I think in the early days of the internet,
a lot of us thought
that information technology
was always going to make it easier
for us to know for ourselves,
and of course in many ways, it has.
But as the internet has become
more and more a part of our lives,
our reliance on it, our use of it,
has become often more passive.
Much of what we know today we Google-know.
We download prepackaged sets of facts
and sort of shuffle them along
the assembly line of social media.
Now, Google-knowing is useful
precisely because it involves
a sort of intellectual outsourcing.
We offload our effort onto a network
of others and algorithms.
And that allows us, of course,
to not clutter our minds
with all sorts of facts.
We can just download them
when we need them.
And that's awesome.




10:00


But there's a difference
between downloading a set of facts
and really understanding how or why
those facts are as they are.
Understanding why
a particular disease spreads,
or how a mathematical proof works,
or why your friend is depressed,
involves more than just downloading.
It's going to require, most likely,
doing some work for yourself:
having a little creative insight;
using your imagination;
getting out into the field;
doing the experiment;
working through the proof;
talking to someone.




10:42


Now, I'm not saying, of course,
that we should stop Google-knowing.
I'm just saying
we shouldn't overvalue it, either.
We need to find ways of encouraging
forms of knowing that are more active,
and don't always involve passing off
our effort into our bubble.
Because the thing about Google-knowing
is that too often it ends up
being bubble-knowing.
And bubble-knowing means
always being right.
But daring to know,
daring to understand,
means risking the possibility
that you could be wrong.
It means risking the possibility
that what you want and what's true
are different things.




11:27


Which brings me to the third thing
that I think we need to do
if we want to accept that we live
in a common reality.
That third thing is:
have a little humility.
By humility here, I mean
epistemic humility,
which means, in a sense,
knowing that you don't know it all.
But it also means something
more than that.
It means seeing your worldview
as open to improvement
by the evidence and experience of others.
Seeing your worldview
as open to improvement
by the evidence and experience of others.
That's more than just
being open to change.
It's more than just being open
to self-improvement.
It means seeing your knowledge
as capable of enhancing
or being enriched
by what others contribute.
That's part of what is involved
in recognizing there's a common reality
that you, too, are responsible to.




12:20


I don't think it's much
of a stretch to say
that our society is not particularly great
at enhancing or encouraging
that sort of humility.
That's partly because,
well, we tend to confuse
arrogance and confidence.
And it's partly because, well, you know,
arrogance is just easier.
It's just easier to think of yourself
as knowing it all.
It's just easier to think of yourself
as having it all figured out.
But that's another example
of the bad faith towards the truth
that I've been talking about.




12:54


So the concept of a common reality,
like a lot of philosophical concepts,
can seem so obvious,
that we can look right past it
and forget why it's important.
Democracies can't function
if their citizens don't strive,
at least some of the time,
to inhabit a common space,
a space where they can pass
ideas back and forth
when  and especially when 
they disagree.
But you can't strive to inhabit that space
if you don't already accept
that you live in the same reality.
To accept that, we've got
to believe in truth,
we've got to encourage
more active ways of knowing.
And we've got to have the humility
to realize that we're not
the measure of all things.




13:48


We may yet one day realize the vision
of having the internet in our brains.
But if we want that to be liberating
and not terrifying,
if we want it to expand our understanding
and not just our passive knowing,
we need to remember that our perspectives,
as wondrous, as beautiful as they are,
are just that 
perspectives on one reality.




14:18


Thank you.

2797,Justin Davidson,Why glass towers are bad for city life -- and what we need instead,http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/2797,"There's a creepy transformation taking over our cities, says architecture critic Justin Davidson. From Houston, Texas to Guangzhou, China, shiny towers of concrete and steel covered with glass are cropping up like an invasive species.

Imagine that when you walked
in here this evening,
you discovered that everybody in the room
looked almost exactly the same:
ageless, raceless,
generically good-looking.
That person sitting right next to you
might have the most
idiosyncratic inner life,
but you don't have a clue
because we're all wearing
the same blank expression all the time.
That is the kind of creepy transformation
that is taking over cities,
only it applies to buildings, not people.




 0:42


Cities are full of roughness and shadow,
texture and color.
You can still find architectural surfaces
of great individuality and character
in apartment buildings in Riga
and Yemen,
social housing in Vienna,
Hopi villages in Arizona,
brownstones in New York,
wooden houses in San Francisco.
These aren't palaces or cathedrals.
These are just ordinary residences
expressing the ordinary
splendor of cities.
And the reason they're like that
is that the need for shelter
is so bound up with
the human desire for beauty.
Their rough surfaces
give us a touchable city.
Right? Streets that you can read
by running your fingers
over brick and stone.




 1:36


But that's getting harder to do,
because cities are becoming smooth.
New downtowns sprout towers
that are almost always
made of concrete and steel
and covered in glass.
You can look at skylines
all over the world 
Houston,
Guangzhou,
Frankfurt 
and you see the same army
of high-gloss robots
marching over the horizon.
Now, just think of everything we lose
when architects stop using
the full range of available materials.
When we reject granite
and limestone and sandstone
and wood and copper
and terra-cotta and brick
and wattle and plaster,
we simplify architecture
and we impoverish cities.
It's as if you reduced
all of the world's cuisines
down to airline food.




 2:30


(Laughter)




 2:31


Chicken or pasta?




 2:34


But worse still,
assemblies of glass towers
like this one in Moscow
suggest a disdain for the civic
and communal aspects of urban living.
Right? Buildings like these are intended
to enrich their owners and tenants,
but not necessarily
the lives of the rest of us,
those of us who navigate
the spaces between the buildings.
And we expect to do so for free.
Shiny towers are an invasive species
and they are choking our cities
and killing off public space.
We tend to think of a facade
as being like makeup,
a decorative layer applied at the end
to a building that's effectively complete.
But just because a facade is superficial
doesn't mean it's not also deep.




 3:21


Let me give you an example
of how a city's surfaces
affect the way we live in it.
When I visited Salamanca in Spain,
I gravitated to the Plaza Mayor
at all hours of the day.
Early in the morning,
sunlight rakes the facades,
sharpening shadows,
and at night, lamplight
segments the buildings
into hundreds of distinct areas,
balconies and windows and arcades,
each one a separate pocket
of visual activity.
That detail and depth, that glamour
gives the plaza a theatrical quality.
It becomes a stage
where the generations can meet.
You have teenagers
sprawling on the pavers,
seniors monopolizing the benches,
and real life starts to look
like an opera set.
The curtain goes up on Salamanca.
So just because I'm talking
about the exteriors of buildings,
not form, not function, not structure,
even so those surfaces
give texture to our lives,
because buildings
create the spaces around them,
and those spaces can draw people in
or push them away.
And the difference often has to do
with the quality of those exteriors.




 4:40


So one contemporary equivalent
of the Plaza Mayor in Salamanca
is the Place de la Dfense in Paris,
a windswept, glass-walled open space
that office workers hurry through
on the way from the metro
to their cubicles
but otherwise spend
as little time in as possible.
In the early 1980s,
the architect Philip Johnson
tried to recreate a gracious
European plaza in Pittsburgh.
This is PPG Place,
a half acre of open space
encircled by commercial buildings
made of mirrored glass.
And he ornamented those buildings
with metal trim and bays
and Gothic turrets
which really pop on the skyline.
But at ground level,
the plaza feels like a black glass cage.
I mean, sure, in summertime
kids are running back and forth
through the fountain
and there's ice-skating in the winter,
but it lacks the informality
of a leisurely hangout.
It's just not the sort of place
you really want to just hang out and chat.




 5:46


Public spaces thrive or fail
for many different reasons.
Architecture is only one,
but it's an important one.
Some recent plazas
like Federation Square in Melbourne
or Superkilen in Copenhagen
succeed because they combine old and new,
rough and smooth,
neutral and bright colors,
and because they don't rely
excessively on glass.




 6:15


Now, I'm not against glass.
It's an ancient and versatile material.
It's easy to manufacture and transport
and install and replace
and clean.
It comes in everything
from enormous, ultraclear sheets
to translucent bricks.
New coatings make it change mood
in the shifting light.
In expensive cities like New York,
it has the magical power
of being able to multiply
real estate values by allowing views,
which is really the only commodity
that developers have to offer
to justify those surreal prices.




 6:55


In the middle of the 19th century,
with the construction
of the Crystal Palace in London,
glass leapt to the top of the list
of quintessentially modern substances.
By the mid-20th century,
it had come to dominate
the downtowns of some American cities,
largely through some
really spectacular office buildings
like Lever House in midtown Manhattan,
designed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill.
Eventually, the technology
advanced to the point
where architects could design
structures so transparent
they practically disappear.
And along the way,
glass became the default material
of the high-rise city,
and there's a very
powerful reason for that.
Because as the world's populations
converge on cities,
the least fortunate pack
into jerry-built shantytowns.
But hundreds of millions of people
need apartments and places to work
in ever-larger buildings,
so it makes economic sense
to put up towers
and wrap them in cheap
and practical curtain walls.




 7:56


But glass has a limited ability
to be expressive.
This is a section of wall framing a plaza
in the pre-Hispanic city of Mitla,
in southern Mexico.
Those 2,000-year-old carvings
make it clear that this was a place
of high ritual significance.
Today we look at those and we can see
a historical and textural continuity
between those carvings,
the mountains all around
and that church which is built
on top of the ruins
using stone plundered from the site.
In nearby Oaxaca,
even ordinary plaster buildings
become canvasses for
bright colors, political murals
and sophisticated graphic arts.
It's an intricate, communicative language
that an epidemic of glass
would simply wipe out.




 8:48


The good news is
that architects and developers
have begun to rediscover
the joys of texture
without backing away from modernity.
Some find innovative uses
for old materials like brick
and terra-cotta.
Others invent new products
like the molded panels that Snhetta used
to give the San Francisco
Museum of Modern Art
that crinkly, sculptural quality.
The architect Stefano Boeri
even created living facades.
This is his Vertical Forest,
a pair of apartment towers in Milan,
whose most visible feature is greenery.
And Boeri is designing a version of this
for Nanjing in China.
And imagine if green facades
were as ubiquitous as glass ones
how much cleaner the air
in Chinese cities would become.




 9:40


But the truth is
that these are mostly one-offs,
boutique projects,
not easily reproduced at a global scale.
And that is the point.
When you use materials
that have a local significance,
you prevent cities
from all looking the same.
Copper has a long history in New York 
the Statue of Liberty,
the crown of the Woolworth Building 
but it fell out of fashion for a long time
until SHoP Architects used it
to cover the American Copper Building,
a pair of twisting towers
on the East River.
It's not even finished
and you can see the way
sunset lights up that metallic facade,
which will weather to green as it ages.




10:24


Buildings can be like people.
Their faces broadcast their experience.
And that's an important point,
because when glass ages,
you just replace it,
and the building looks
pretty much the same way it did before
until eventually it's demolished.
Almost all other materials
have the ability
to absorb infusions of history and memory,
and project it into the present.
The firm Ennead
clad the Utah Natural History Museum
in Salt Lake City in copper and zinc,
ores that have been mined
in the area for 150 years
and that also camouflage the building
against the ochre hills
so that you have a natural history museum
that reflects the region's
natural history.
And when the Chinese
Pritzker Prize winner Wang Shu
was building a history museum in Ningbo,
he didn't just create
a wrapper for the past,
he built memory right into the walls
by using brick and stones and shingles
salvaged from villages
that had been demolished.




11:35


Now, architects can use glass
in equally lyrical and inventive ways.
Here in New York, two buildings,
one by Jean Nouvel
and this one by Frank Gehry
face off across West 19th Street,
and the play of reflections
that they toss back and forth
is like a symphony in light.
But when a city defaults to glass
as it grows,
it becomes a hall of mirrors,
disquieting and cold.
After all, cities are places
of concentrated variety
where the world's cultures
and languages and lifestyles
come together and mingle.
So rather than encase all that variety
and diversity in buildings
of crushing sameness,
we should have an architecture that honors
the full range of the urban experience.

Paying close attention to something:
Not that easy, is it?
It's because our attention is pulled
in so many different directions at a time,
and it's in fact pretty impressive
if you can stay focused.




 0:27


Many people think that attention
is all about what we are focusing on,
but it's also about what information
our brain is trying to filter out.

There are two ways
you direct your attention.
First, there's overt attention.
In overt attention,
you move your eyes towards something
in order to pay attention to it.
Then there's covert attention.
In covert attention,
you pay attention to something,
but without moving your eyes.
Think of driving for a second.
Your overt attention,
your direction of the eyes,
are in front,
but that's your covert attention
which is constantly scanning
the surrounding area,
where you don't actually look at them.

how well our brain functions.
And if it doesn't function well,
then these computers themselves
can be used as assistive devices
for therapies.
But that also means something,
because choosing the wrong patterns
will give us the wrong models
and therefore the wrong therapies.
Right?
In case of attention,
the fact that we can
shift our attention not only by our eyes
but also by thinking 
that makes covert attention
an interesting model for computers.




 2:13


So I wanted to know
what are the brainwave patterns
when you look overtly
or when you look covertly.
I set up an experiment for that.
In this experiment
there are two flickering squares,
one of them flickering
at a slower rate than the other one.
Depending on which of these flickers
you are paying attention to,
certain parts of your brain
will start resonating in the same rate
as that flickering rate.
So by analyzing your brain signals,
we can track where exactly
you are watching
or you are paying attention to.




 2:54


So to see what happens in your brain
when you pay overt attention,
I asked people to look directly
in one of the squares
and pay attention to it.
In this case, not surprisingly,
we saw that these flickering squares
appeared in their brain signals
which was coming
from the back of their head,
which is responsible for the processing
of your visual information.
But I was really interested
to see what happens in your brain
when you pay covert attention.
So this time I asked people
to look in the middle of the screen
and without moving their eyes,
to pay attention
to either of these squares.
When we did that,
we saw that both of these flickering rates
appeared in their brain signals,
but interestingly,
only one of them,
which was paid attention to,
had stronger signals,
so there was something in the brain
which was handling this information
so that thing in the brain was basically
the activation of the frontal area.
The front part of your brain
is responsible
for higher cognitive functions as a human.
The frontal part,
it seems that it works as a filter
trying to let information come in
only from the right flicker
that you are paying attention to
and trying to inhibit the information
coming from the ignored one.




 4:26


The filtering ability of the brain
is indeed a key for attention,
which is missing in some people,
for example in people with ADHD.
So a person with ADHD
cannot inhibit these distractors,
and that's why they can't focus
for a long time on a single task.
But what if this person
could play a specific computer game
with his brain connected to the computer,
and then train his own brain
to inhibit these distractors?




 5:04


Well, ADHD is just one example.
We can use these cognitive
brain-machine interfaces
for many other cognitive fields.
It was just a few years ago
that my grandfather had a stroke,
and he lost complete ability to speak.
He could understand everybody,
but there was no way to respond,
even not writing
because he was illiterate.
So he passed away in silence.
I remember thinking at that time:
What if we could have a computer
which could speak for him?
Now, after years that I am in this field,
I can see that this might be possible.
Imagine if we can find brainwave patterns
when people think
about images or even letters,
like the letter A generates
a different brainwave pattern
than the letter B, and so on.
Could a computer one day
communicate for people who can't speak?
What if a computer
can help us understand
the thoughts of a person in a coma?
We are not there yet,
but pay close attention.
We will be there soon.




 6:22


Thank you.

How can we overcome self-paralysis and take action? Tim Ferriss encourages us to fully envision and write down our fears in detail, in a simple but powerful exercise he calls ""fear-setting."" Learn more about how this practice can help you thrive in high-stress environments and separate what you can control from what you cannot.",http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/2799/transcript?language=en,4,2017,TED2017,0:13:21,6/12/17,582001,"choice,fear,goal-setting,humanity,life,personal growth,success,work,work-life balance","0:11


So, this happy pic of me
was taken in 1999.
I was a senior in college,
and it was right after a dance practice.
I was really, really happy.
And I remember exactly where I was
about a week and a half later.
I was sitting in the back
of my used minivan
in a campus parking lot,
when I decided
I was going to commit suicide.
I went from deciding
to full-blown planning very quickly.
And I came this close
to the edge of the precipice.
It's the closest I've ever come.
And the only reason I took
my finger off the trigger
was thanks to a few lucky coincidences.
And after the fact,
that's what scared me the most:
the element of chance.




 0:56


So I became very methodical
about testing different ways
that I could manage my ups and downs,
which has proven to be
a good investment. (Laughs)
Many normal people might have,
say, six to 10 major depressive episodes
in their lives.
I have bipolar depression.
It runs in my family.
I've had 50-plus at this point,
and I've learned a lot.
I've had a lot of at-bats,
many rounds in the ring with darkness,
taking good notes.
So I thought rather than get up
and give any type of recipe for success
or highlight reel,
I would share my recipe
for avoiding self-destruction,
and certainly self-paralysis.




 1:37


And the tool I've found which has proven
to be the most reliable safety net
for emotional free fall
is actually the same tool
that has helped me to make
my best business decisions.
But that is secondary.
And it is ... stoicism.
That sounds boring.




 1:54


(Laughter)




 1:55


You might think of Spock,
or it might conjure and image like this 




 1:59


(Laughter)




 2:01


a cow standing in the rain.
It's not sad. It's not particularly happy.
It's just an impassive creature taking
whatever life sends its way.




 2:10


You might not think of the ultimate
competitor, say, Bill Belichick,
head coach of the New England Patriots,
who has the all-time NFL record
for Super Bowl titles.
And stoicism has spread like wildfire
in the top of the NFL ranks
as a means of mental toughness
training in the last few years.
You might not think
of the Founding Fathers 
Thomas Jefferson, John Adams,
George Washington
to name but three students of stoicism.
George Washington actually had
a play about a Stoic 
this was ""Cato, a Tragedy"" 
performed for his troops at Valley Forge
to keep them motivated.




 2:49


So why would people of action
focus so much on an ancient philosophy?
This seems very academic.
I would encourage you to think
about stoicism a little bit differently,
as an operating system for thriving
in high-stress environments,
for making better decisions.
And it all started here,
kind of,
on a porch.




 3:09


So around 300 BC in Athens,
someone named Zeno of Citium
taught many lectures
walking around a painted porch, a ""stoa.""
That later became ""stoicism.""
And in the Greco-Roman world,
people used stoicism
as a comprehensive system
for doing many, many things.
But for our purposes, chief among them
was training yourself
to separate what you can control
from what you cannot control,
and then doing exercises
to focus exclusively
on the former.
This decreases emotional reactivity,
which can be a superpower.




 3:45


Conversely, let's say
you're a quarterback.
You miss a pass.
You get furious with yourself.
That could cost you a game.
If you're a CEO, and you fly
off the handle at a very valued employee
because of a minor infraction,
that could cost you the employee.
If you're a college student
who, say, is in a downward spiral,
and you feel helpless and hopeless,
unabated, that could cost you your life.
So the stakes are very, very high.




 4:13


And there are many tools
in the toolkit to get you there.
I'm going to focus on one
that completely changed my life in 2004.
It found me then because of two things:
a very close friend, young guy, my age,
died of pancreatic cancer unexpectedly,
and then my girlfriend, who I thought
I was going to marry, walked out.
She'd had enough, and she didn't
give me a Dear John letter,
but she did give me this,
a Dear John plaque.




 4:40


(Laughter)




 4:41


I'm not making this up. I've kept it.
""Business hours are over at five o'clock.""
She gave this to me
to put on my desk for personal health,
because at the time, I was working
on my first real business.
I had no idea what I was doing.
I was working 14-plus hour days,
seven days a week.
I was using stimulants to get going.
I was using depressants
to wind down and go to sleep.
It was a disaster.
I felt completely trapped.
I bought a book on simplicity
to try to find answers.




 5:09


And I did find a quote
that made a big difference in my life,
which was, ""We suffer more often
in imagination than in reality,""
by Seneca the Younger,
who was a famous Stoic writer.
That took me to his letters,
which took me to the exercise,
""premeditatio malorum,""
which means the pre-meditation of evils.
In simple terms,
this is visualizing the worst-case
scenarios, in detail, that you fear,
preventing you from taking action,
so that you can take action
to overcome that paralysis.
My problem was monkey mind 
super loud, very incessant.
Just thinking my way
through problems doesn't work.
I needed to capture my thoughts on paper.
So I created a written exercise
that I called ""fear-setting,""
like goal-setting,
for myself.
It consists of three pages.
Super simple.




 6:00


The first page is right here.
""What if I ...?""
This is whatever you fear,
whatever is causing you anxiety,
whatever you're putting off.
It could be asking someone out,
ending a relationship,
asking for a promotion,
quitting a job, starting a company.
It could be anything.
For me, it was taking
my first vacation in four years
and stepping away from my business
for a month to go to London,
where I could stay
in a friend's room for free,
to either remove myself
as a bottleneck in the business
or shut it down.




 6:31


In the first column, ""Define,""
you're writing down all of the worst
things you can imagine happening
if you take that step.
You want 10 to 20.
I won't go through all of them,
but I'll give you two examples.
One was, I'll go to London,
it'll be rainy, I'll get depressed,
the whole thing will be
a huge waste of time.
Number two, I'll miss
a letter from the IRS,
and I'll get audited
or raided or shut down or some such.




 6:56


And then you go to the ""Prevent"" column.
In that column, you write
down the answer to:
What could I do to prevent
each of these bullets from happening,
or, at the very least, decrease
the likelihood even a little bit?
So for getting depressed in London,
I could take a portable blue light with me
and use it for 15 minutes in the morning.
I knew that helped stave off
depressive episodes.
For the IRS bit, I could change
the mailing address on file with the IRS
so the paperwork would go to my accountant
instead of to my UPS address.
Easy-peasy.




 7:26


Then we go to ""Repair.""
So if the worst-case scenarios happen,
what could you do to repair
the damage even a little bit,
or who could you ask for help?
So in the first case, London,
well, I could fork over some money,
fly to Spain, get some sun 
undo the damage, if I got into a funk.
In the case of missing
a letter from the IRS,
I could call a friend who is a lawyer
or ask, say, a professor of law
what they would recommend,
who I should talk to,
how had people handled this in the past.
So one question to keep in mind
as you're doing this first page is:
Has anyone else in the history of time
less intelligent or less driven
figured this out?
Chances are, the answer is ""Yes.""




 8:10


(Laughter)




 8:11


The second page is simple:
What might be the benefits
of an attempt or a partial success?
You can see we're playing up the fears
and really taking a conservative
look at the upside.
So if you attempted whatever
you're considering,
might you build confidence,
develop skills,
emotionally, financially, otherwise?
What might be the benefits
of, say, a base hit?
Spend 10 to 15 minutes on this.




 8:36


Page three.
This might be the most important,
so don't skip it:
""The Cost of Inaction.""
Humans are very good at considering
what might go wrong
if we try something new,
say, ask for a raise.
What we don't often consider
is the atrocious cost of the status quo 
not changing anything.
So you should ask yourself,
if I avoid this action or decision
and actions and decisions like it,
what might my life look like in,
say, six months, 12 months, three years?
Any further out, it starts
to seem intangible.
And really get detailed 
again, emotionally, financially,
physically, whatever.




 9:17


And when I did this, it painted
a terrifying picture.
I was self-medicating,
my business was going to implode
at any moment at all times,
if I didn't step away.
My relationships were fraying or failing.
And I realized that inaction
was no longer an option for me.




 9:35


Those are the three pages. That's it.
That's fear-setting.
And after this, I realized
that on a scale of one to 10,
one being minimal impact,
10 being maximal impact,
if I took the trip, I was risking
a one to three of temporary
and reversible pain
for an eight to 10 of positive,
life-changing impact
that could be a semi-permanent.
So I took the trip.
None of the disasters came to pass.
There were some hiccups, sure.
I was able to extricate myself
from the business.
I ended up extending that trip
for a year and a half around the world,
and that became the basis
for my first book,
that leads me here today.




10:11


And I can trace all of my biggest wins
and all of my biggest disasters averted
back to doing fear-setting
at least once a quarter.
It's not a panacea.
You'll find that some of your fears
are very well-founded.




10:26


(Laughter)




10:27


But you shouldn't conclude that
without first putting them
under a microscope.
And it doesn't make all the hard times,
the hard choices, easy,
but it can make a lot of them easier.




10:38


I'd like to close with a profile
of one of my favorite modern-day Stoics.
This is Jerzy Gregorek.
He is a four-time world champion
in Olympic weightlifting,
political refugee,
published poet,
62 years old.
He can still kick my ass and probably
most asses in this room.
He's an impressive guy.




10:59


I spent a lot of time
on his stoa, his porch,
asking life and training advice.
He was part of the Solidarity in Poland,
which was a nonviolent
movement for social change
that was violently suppressed
by the government.
He lost his career as a firefighter.
Then his mentor, a priest,
was kidnapped, tortured, killed
and thrown into a river.
He was then threatened.
He and his wife had to flee Poland,
bounce from country to country
until they landed in the US
with next to nothing,
sleeping on floors.




11:29


He now lives in Woodside, California,
in a very nice place,
and of the 10,000-plus people
I've met in my life,
I would put him in the top 10,
in terms of success and happiness.
And there's a punchline coming,
so pay attention.
I sent him a text a few weeks ago,
asking him: Had he ever read
any Stoic philosophy?
And he replied with two pages of text.
This is very unlike him.
He is a terse dude.




11:53


(Laughter)




11:54


And not only was he familiar
with stoicism,
but he pointed out, for all
of his most important decisions,
his inflection points,
when he stood up
for his principles and ethics,
how he had used stoicism
and something akin to fear-setting,
which blew my mind.




12:11


And he closed with two things.
Number one: he couldn't imagine
any life more beautiful
than that of a Stoic.
And the last was his mantra,
which he applies to everything,
and you can apply to everything:




12:26


""Easy choices, hard life.
Hard choices, easy life.""




12:33


The hard choices 
what we most fear doing, asking, saying 
these are very often exactly
what we most need to do.
And the biggest challenges
and problems we face
will never be solved
with comfortable conversations,
whether it's in your own head
or with other people.




12:54


So I encourage you to ask yourselves:
Where in your lives right now
might defining your fears be more
important than defining your goals?
Keeping in mind all the while,
the words of Seneca:
""We suffer more often
in imagination than in reality.""




13:11


Thank you very much.

2801,Anne Lamott,12 truths I learned from life and writing,http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/2801,"A few days before she turned 61, writer Anne Lamott decided to write down everything she knew for sure. She dives into the nuances of being a human who lives in a confusing, beautiful, emotional world, offering her characteristic life-affirming wisdom and humor on family, writing, the meaning of God, death and more.",http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/2801/transcript?language=en,4,2017,TED2017,0:15:55,6/9/17,651425,"Christianity,God,aging,art,beauty,birds,books,communication,family,friendship,funny,humanity,love,personal growth,self,society,writing","0:12


My seven-year-old grandson
sleeps just down the hall from me,
and he wakes up a lot of mornings
and he says,
""You know, this could be
the best day ever.""
And other times,
in the middle of the night,
he calls out in a tremulous voice,
""Nana, will you ever get sick and die?""




 0:30


I think this pretty much says it for me
and most of the people I know,
that we're a mixed grill
of happy anticipation
and dread.
So I sat down a few days
before my 61st birthday,
and I decided to compile a list
of everything I know for sure.
There's so little truth
in the popular culture,
and it's good to be sure of a few things.




 0:56


For instance, I am no longer 47,
although this is the age I feel,
and the age I like to think
of myself as being.
My friend Paul used to say in his late 70s
that he felt like a young man
with something really wrong with him.




 1:12


(Laughter)




 1:16


Our true person is outside
of time and space,
but looking at the paperwork,
I can, in fact, see
that I was born in 1954.
My inside self is outside
of time and space.
It doesn't have an age.
I'm every age I've ever been,
and so are you,
although I can't help
mentioning as an aside
that it might have been helpful
if I hadn't followed
the skin care rules of the '60s,
which involved getting
as much sun as possible
while slathered in baby oil
and basking in the glow
of a tinfoil reflector shield.




 1:50


(Laughter)




 1:52


It was so liberating, though,
to face the truth
that I was no longer
in the last throes of middle age,
that I decided to write down
every single true thing I know.
People feel really doomed
and overwhelmed these days,
and they keep asking me what's true.
So I hope that my list of things
I'm almost positive about
might offer some basic
operating instructions
to anyone who is feeling
really overwhelmed or beleaguered.




 2:23


Number one:
the first and truest thing
is that all truth is a paradox.
Life is both a precious,
unfathomably beautiful gift,
and it's impossible here,
on the incarnational side of things.
It's been a very bad match
for those of us who were born
extremely sensitive.
It's so hard and weird
that we sometimes wonder
if we're being punked.
It's filled simultaneously
with heartbreaking sweetness and beauty,
desperate poverty,
floods and babies and acne and Mozart,
all swirled together.
I don't think it's an ideal system.




 3:03


(Laughter)




 3:06


Number two: almost
everything will work again
if you unplug it for a few minutes 




 3:12


(Laughter)




 3:14


(Applause)




 3:18


including you.




 3:21


Three: there is almost
nothing outside of you
that will help in any kind of lasting way,
unless you're waiting for an organ.
You can't buy, achieve or date
serenity and peace of mind.
This is the most horrible truth,
and I so resent it.
But it's an inside job,
and we can't arrange peace
or lasting improvement
for the people we love most in the world.
They have to find their own ways,
their own answers.
You can't run alongside
your grown children
with sunscreen and ChapStick
on their hero's journey.
You have to release them.
It's disrespectful not to.
And if it's someone else's problem,
you probably don't have
the answer, anyway.




 4:10


(Laughter)




 4:11


Our help is usually not very helpful.
Our help is often toxic.
And help is the sunny side of control.
Stop helping so much.
Don't get your help and goodness
all over everybody.




 4:27


(Laughter)




 4:30


(Applause)




 4:32


This brings us to number four:
everyone is screwed up,
broken, clingy and scared,
even the people who seem
to have it most together.
They are much more like you
than you would believe,
so try not to compare your insides
to other people's outsides.
It will only make you worse
than you already are.




 4:50


(Laughter)




 4:55


Also, you can't save, fix
or rescue any of them
or get anyone sober.
What helped me get clean
and sober 30 years ago
was the catastrophe
of my behavior and thinking.
So I asked some sober friends for help,
and I turned to a higher power.
One acronym for God
is the ""gift of desperation,""
G-O-D,
or as a sober friend put it,
by the end I was deteriorating faster
than I could lower my standards.




 5:23


(Laughter)




 5:30


So God might mean, in this case,
""me running out of any more good ideas.""




 5:36


While fixing and saving
and trying to rescue is futile,
radical self-care is quantum,
and it radiates out from you
into the atmosphere
like a little fresh air.
It's a huge gift to the world.
When people respond by saying,
""Well, isn't she full of herself,""
just smile obliquely like Mona Lisa
and make both of you a nice cup of tea.
Being full of affection
for one's goofy, self-centered,
cranky, annoying self
is home.
It's where world peace begins.




 6:16


Number five:
chocolate with 75 percent cacao
is not actually a food.




 6:22


(Laughter)




 6:26


Its best use is as a bait in snake traps
or to balance the legs of wobbly chairs.
It was never meant
to be considered an edible.




 6:40


Number six 




 6:42


(Laughter)




 6:45


writing.
Every writer you know writes
really terrible first drafts,
but they keep their butt in the chair.
That's the secret of life.
That's probably the main difference
between you and them.
They just do it.
They do it by prearrangement
with themselves.
They do it as a debt of honor.
They tell stories that come through them
one day at a time, little by little.
When my older brother was in fourth grade,
he had a term paper on birds
due the next day,
and he hadn't started.
So my dad sat down with him
with an Audubon book,
paper, pencils and brads 
for those of you who have gotten
a little less young and remember brads 
and he said to my brother,
""Just take it bird by bird, buddy.
Just read about pelicans
and then write about pelicans
in your own voice.
And then find out about chickadees,
and tell us about them in your own voice.
And then geese.""




 7:51


So the two most important things
about writing are: bird by bird
and really god-awful first drafts.
If you don't know where to start,
remember that every single thing
that happened to you is yours,
and you get to tell it.
If people wanted you to write
more warmly about them,
they should've behaved better.




 8:10


(Laughter)




 8:13


(Applause)




 8:18


You're going to feel like hell
if you wake up someday
and you never wrote the stuff
that is tugging on the sleeves
of your heart:
your stories, memories,
visions and songs 
your truth,
your version of things 
in your own voice.
That's really all you have to offer us,
and that's also why you were born.




 8:41


Seven: publication and temporary
creative successes
are something you have to recover from.
They kill as many people as not.
They will hurt, damage and change you
in ways you cannot imagine.
The most degraded
and evil people I've ever known
are male writers who've had
huge best sellers.
And yet, returning to number one,
that all truth is paradox,
it's also a miracle
to get your work published,
to get your stories read and heard.
Just try to bust yourself
gently of the fantasy
that publication will heal you,
that it will fill the Swiss-cheesy
holes inside of you.
It can't.
It won't.
But writing can.
So can singing in a choir
or a bluegrass band.
So can painting community
murals or birding
or fostering old dogs
that no one else will.




 9:39


Number eight: families.
Families are hard, hard, hard,
no matter how cherished
and astonishing they may also be.
Again, see number one.




 9:52


(Laughter)




 9:53


At family gatherings where you suddenly
feel homicidal or suicidal 




 9:57


(Laughter)




 9:59


remember that in all cases,
it's a miracle that any of us,
specifically, were conceived and born.
Earth is forgiveness school.
It begins with forgiving yourself,
and then you might as well
start at the dinner table.
That way, you can do this work
in comfortable pants.




10:19


(Laughter)




10:22


When William Blake said that we are here
to learn to endure the beams of love,
he knew that your family would be
an intimate part of this,
even as you want to run screaming
for your cute little life.
But I promise you are up to it.
You can do it, Cinderella, you can do it,
and you will be amazed.




10:44


Nine: food.
Try to do a little better.
I think you know what I mean.




10:52


(Laughter)




11:02


Number 10 




11:03


(Laughter)




11:05


grace.
Grace is spiritual WD-40,
or water wings.
The mystery of grace is that God loves
Henry Kissinger and Vladimir Putin
and me
exactly as much as He or She

The movement of grace
is what changes us, heals us
and heals our world.
To summon grace, say, ""Help,""
and then buckle up.
Grace finds you exactly where you are,
but it doesn't leave you
where it found you.
And grace won't look
like Casper the Friendly Ghost,
regrettably.
But the phone will ring
or the mail will come
and then against all odds,
you'll get your sense of humor
about yourself back.
Laughter really is carbonated holiness.
It helps us breathe again and again
and gives us back to ourselves,
and this gives us faith
in life and each other.
And remember  grace always bats last.

Eleven: God just means goodness.
It's really not all that scary.
It means the divine or a loving,
animating intelligence,
or, as we learned
from the great ""Deteriorata,""
""the cosmic muffin.""
A good name for God is: ""Not me.""
Emerson said that
the happiest person on Earth
is the one who learns from nature
the lessons of worship.
So go outside a lot and look up.
My pastor said you can trap bees
on the bottom of mason jars without lids
because they don't look up,
so they just walk around bitterly
bumping into the glass walls.
Go outside. Look up.
Secret of life.




12:58


And finally: death.
Number 12.
Wow and yikes.
It's so hard to bear when the few people
you cannot live without die.
You'll never get over these losses,
and no matter what the culture says,
you're not supposed to.
We Christians like to think of death
as a major change of address,
but in any case, the person
will live again fully in your heart
if you don't seal it off.
Like Leonard Cohen said,
""There are cracks in everything,
and that's how the light gets in.""
And that's how we feel
our people again fully alive.




13:38


Also, the people will make
you laugh out loud
at the most inconvenient times,
and that's the great good news.
But their absence will also be a lifelong
nightmare of homesickness for you.
Grief and friends, time and tears
will heal you to some extent.
Tears will bathe and baptize
and hydrate and moisturize you
and the ground on which you walk.




14:03


Do you know the first thing
that God says to Moses?
He says, ""Take off your shoes.""
Because this is holy ground,
all evidence to the contrary.
It's hard to believe,
but it's the truest thing I know.
When you're a little bit older,
like my tiny personal self,
you realize that death
is as sacred as birth.
And don't worry  get on with your life.
Almost every single death
is easy and gentle
with the very best people surrounding you
for as long as you need.
You won't be alone.
They'll help you cross over
to whatever awaits us.
As Ram Dass said,
""When all is said and done,
we're really just all walking
each other home.""




14:54


I think that's it,
but if I think of anything else,
I'll let you know.




14:59


Thank you.




15:00


(Applause)




15:02


Thank you.




15:03


(Applause)




15:05


I was very surprised to be asked to come,
because it is not my realm,
technology or design or entertainment.
I mean, my realm is sort of
faith and writing
and kind of lurching along together.
And I was surprised,
but they said I could give a talk,
and I said I'd love to.




15:24


(Video) If you don't know where to start,
remember that every single thing
that happened to you is yours
and you get to tell it.




15:31


Anne Lamott: People are very frightened
and feel really doomed
in America these days,
and I just wanted to help people
get their sense of humor about it
and to realize how much isn't a problem.
If you take an action,
take a really healthy or loving
or friendly action,
you'll have loving and friendly feelings.",

Michael Browning: engineer,
innovator 
inventor, really 
and inspiring father.
He had a passion for flight,
as you can kind of sense
from that rather dubious
1970s office-leaving present.
And some 40 years after that was created,
a small group of us got together
to have a go,
a run at the whole challenge of flight
that inspired people for years,
and do it in a very different kind of way.
And that's the journey I'd like
to share with you now.




 0:42


The starting hypothesis was one
of the human mind and body,
which, as you've seen
for the last few days here,
is an amazing construct.
What if you augmented
that wonderful machine
with just the right technology?
If you approach flight
in that kind of real way,
where could you get to?




 0:58


So my training partner here
back in London, Denton,
is doing a much better job
of that kind of stuff than me.
Guess what? It's London.
The idea was that you augment that.
And so, how do you augment that?
Well, we bought one of these.




 1:14


This is a micro gas turbine.
This was ground zero,
so that little piece of kit
proved really quite impressive,
so we got two in a field.
The real hero here, by the way,
is, right in the background,
there's a lady tending some vegetables,
who does a brilliant job
of trying to ignore us for a while 




 1:33


(Laughter)




 1:36


I think the only thing
less happy is the grass,
that we did probably damage quite badly.




 1:41


You get an idea of the thrust here,
when I try to hold them horizontally
and somewhat fail.
That's around 50 kilos of thrust there.
We were quite impressed with that.
We thought we were getting somewhere.




 1:51


So there's only one sensible way
to go from there:
you get four.




 1:56


(Laughter)




 2:01


I have to say, I still like
watching these back.




 2:04


So then we thought well, let's try
and spread the load a bit.
The legs are designed to take the load,
so why don't we spread it out a bit?
That bit was good.
The harness 
a nice idea but it didn't really work,
as you'll see now.
This whole journey was very much
about trying things 




 2:21


(Laughter)




 2:22


Yeah, it really didn't work, did it?




 2:24


Trying things and learning
by failing at them most of the time.
And that included failing by falling over.
If you notice, we've got
five engines here 
not to be put off by the fact
one was in maintenance,
still had a go.




 2:39


(Laughter)




 2:40


And then I pinched a fuel line.
So again, good learning.
We learned not to do that again.




 2:46


This was a blind alley.




 2:47


(Laughter)




 2:48


This was three on each arm 
that was ridiculous.
That was 70 kilos on each arm.
Again, struck that one off.




 2:54


(Laughter)




 2:56


But we were starting to make
some really quite convincing progress,
just enough to make you
believe that maybe 
maybe we could get there.
You can see, look  tantalizing.
The model of one on each leg
and two on each arm,
on paper, that was enough thrust.
And then we did what
I'm about to show you now,
and I still love watching this one.
This was our first six-second,
reasonably coherent flight.




 3:26


(Applause)




 3:30


That was the point where
this endeavor went from:
""I'm really not sure
this is going to work,""
to: ""Oh my god, it does work!""
From there on we then refined it,
but we carried on falling over a lot.
Falling over, like I say, is definitely
the best way to learn.
After a while, we starting
really refining the layout of all of this.
And you'll see,
that's stability and control 
there's no wires there or anything 
that's a combination of us
refining the technology,
including with a Tupperware box
on the back for the electronics
and actually learning
the balance and control.




 4:03


I'm now going to save your ears
for the next short piece
and talk over it.
After a while, the jet engine
noise is a bit annoying.
This is only a few weeks ago.
You can see the stability and control
is really quite nice,
and I'd like to think this somewhat
validates that starting hypothesis,
that the human mind and body,
if properly augmented in that way,
can achieve some pretty cool stuff.
I mean, like I said:
I'm not thinking about where
I'm moving my arms at that stage.
I'm looking at the objective
of where I want to get to,
and a bit like riding a bike,
my arms are just doing their thing.
It's a very strange experience.




 4:36


So where is all this headed?




 4:38


I'll talk over this landing 
I think I land in this one.




 4:42


Well, I don't think anybody's going
to go down to Walmart
or take the kids to school
in any of this stuff for a while,
but the team at Gravity are building
some awesome technology
that's going to make
this look like child's play.
We're working on some things
that will seek to bring
this unusual experience of flight
to a wider audience, beyond the events
and displays we're doing.
We're even starting to look
for pilots two and three,
if there's any volunteers.




 5:04


I've got this vision.
It sounds audacious,
but let's just stick it out there,
that one day maybe we can
rise up above a beach,
fly up and down the coastline
of it, rise up a bit higher,
with some of the safety kit
we're working on to make this achievable.
Then over the horizon comes
a Hercules with the ramp down.
As it comes past,
you start picking up speed
and see if we can intercept 
from the rear, not the front,
that would be a mistake 
and then try and land in the back.
And as I say, that's a little
way off at the moment.




 5:30


But this is also, if I take
a big step back from this,
this is also a very
personal journey for me.
Back to that lovely photo,
or photo in a picture.
Sadly, my father took
his own life when I was 15,
and left an awful lot
of unfulfilled ambition.
He was a wonderful inventor,
a maverick creator.
And I'd just like to think,
if it was possible,
if he was looking down,
he would be 
he'd certainly be smiling at some
of the things we've done here,
I think.
So, it's a tribute to him.




 6:02


Thank you very much.




 6:03


(Applause)




 6:07


(Voice-over) Richard Browning:
I'm probably more nervous
about doing the demo after this.
I've got a lot of things
to get done today.
Worst-case scenario,
we don't get a clean start.




 6:15


Or we get an unplanned failure
while I'm actually flying around.
This is why we keep it very low,
so the worst is I just look like an idiot
and fall on my rear, as I said.
So you can all enjoy that if that happens.
